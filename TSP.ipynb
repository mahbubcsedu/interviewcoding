        "\n",
        "The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is one of the most famous combinatorial optimization problems in computer science and operations research. The problem can be stated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Given a set of cities and the distances between every pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting city.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The TSP is NP-hard, meaning there is no known polynomial-time solution for the general case (for large numbers of cities). However, there are several approaches to solve TSP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Brute Force** (Exponential Time)\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming** (Held-Karp Algorithm, \\( O(n^2 \\cdot 2^n) \\))\n",

        "### Approach to Solve TSP\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Brute Force**:\n",
        "   - Generate all permutations of the cities.\n",
        "   - Calculate the cost of visiting all cities and return to the starting city.\n",
        "   - This is computationally expensive (\\(O(n!)\\)) but guarantees an optimal solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)**:\n",
        "   - This is a more efficient approach that solves TSP in \\(O(n^2 \\cdot 2^n)\\) time using dynamic programming. It works by storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **State Representation**:\n",
        "   - Define `dp[mask][i]` to be the shortest path that visits all cities in the bitmask `mask` and ends at city `i`.\n",
        "   - The transition is:\n",
        "     - `dp[mask][i] = min(dp[mask ^ (1 << i)][j] + dist[j][i])` where `j` is any city in the subset represented by `mask ^ (1 << i)` and `dist[j][i]` is the distance from city `j` to city `i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Greedy Heuristic**:\n",
        "   - A simple greedy approach that chooses the nearest unvisited city at each step. While it is much faster than the exact solutions, it doesn't always give the optimal result.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Backtracking/Branch and Bound**:\n",

        "\n",
        "Given a list of strings, the goal is to find the shortest string that contains every string in the list as a substring.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is essentially a **shortest superstring problem**, which is a variation of the **string overlap problem**. This can be transformed into a **graph problem** where:\n",
        "1. Each string is a **node** in the graph.\n",
        "2. The **edges** between nodes represent the overlap between two strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is to:\n",
        "- **Maximize the overlap** between any two strings when concatenating them. This ensures that the superstring is as short as possible.\n",
        "- Use **Hierholzerâ€™s algorithm** to construct the Eulerian path that will visit each string (node) while minimizing the total length of the resulting superstring.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps to Solve\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Construct the Overlap Graph**:\n",
        "   - **Nodes** represent the strings.\n",
        "   - **Edges** represent the overlap between two strings. Specifically, for each pair of strings \\( S_i \\) and \\( S_j \\), the weight of the edge is the length of the maximum suffix of \\( S_i \\) that overlaps with the prefix of \\( S_j \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Build a Directed Graph**:\n",
        "   - Construct a directed graph where each edge represents a possible concatenation between two strings with maximum overlap.\n",
        "   - The weight of the edge will be the amount of overlap (e.g., if string \\( S_1 \\) ends with \"abc\" and \\( S_2 \\) starts with \"abc\", the edge weight will be 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Eulerian Path**:\n",
        "   - The problem boils down to finding a path that visits each string exactly once and minimizes the total length of the superstring.\n",
        "   - Hierholzer's algorithm helps in finding such a path by determining the **Eulerian path** in this graph of strings. Each step in the path corresponds to adding a string to the superstring.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Construct the Shortest Superstring**:\n",
        "   - Once the Eulerian path is found, concatenate the strings in the correct order, minimizing overlap at each step.\n",
        "   - If the graph is constructed correctly and the overlaps are calculated properly, the result will be the shortest superstring.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Algorithmic Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calculate Overlaps**:\n",
        "   For each pair of strings \\( S_i \\) and \\( S_j \\), compute the maximum overlap. This can be done using dynamic programming or by trying different prefixes and suffixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Greedy Approach for Building the Graph**:\n",
        "   Create a graph where the vertices are the strings, and the edges represent the maximal overlap between two strings. We can use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to determine the best overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Eulerian Path**:\n",
        "   Use Hierholzerâ€™s algorithm to construct the Eulerian path. In this case, you need to find a path where you start at a vertex and follow the edges that represent concatenations of the strings in such a way that all strings are used exactly once.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Rebuild the Superstring**:\n",
        "   Once the Eulerian path is found, you can reconstruct the shortest superstring by concatenating the strings, accounting for the overlaps.\n",

        "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
        "1. **`overlap` function**: This calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to form the directed graph of overlaps.\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: The DP table `dp[mask][i]` represents the shortest superstring that covers the subset of words represented by `mask`, and ends with the `i`-th word.\n",
        "3. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we reconstruct the order of words in the superstring using the `parent` table, which tracks the optimal path taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity:\n",
        "- **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap between each pair of strings can be calculated in O(m * n) time, where m and n are the lengths of the strings. This gives an overall time complexity for calculating overlaps as \\( O(n^2 \\cdot \\text{len}(word)) \\).\n",
        "- **DP Table Calculation**: The dynamic programming table requires checking all subsets of words (which is \\( O(2^n) \\)) and for each subset, checking each pair of words (which is \\( O(n^2) \\)), resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n^2 \\cdot 2^n) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is closely related to **Hierholzerâ€™s Algorithm** as it involves finding a path through the overlap graph (maximizing overlap between strings). The solution involves a **dynamic programming** approach combined with overlap computation, and Hierholzer's algorithm provides insight into how to optimally visit each \"node\" (string) in the shortest path sequence."
