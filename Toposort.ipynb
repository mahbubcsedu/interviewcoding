        "##How to figure out that a problem can be solved by topological sorting\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine whether a problem involves a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), you can look for certain clues and characteristics in the problem statement. Here are some tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Direction and Cycles:**\n",
        "   - A DAG has directed edges and no cycles. If the problem specifies directed relationships and emphasizes that there are no cycles, it likely involves a DAG.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Topological Sorting:**\n",
        "   - If the problem requires you to order or schedule tasks in a sequence such that each task follows certain prerequisites, this is a strong indicator of a DAG. Topological sorting is a common algorithm used on DAGs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dependencies:**\n",
        "   - Look for problems that mention dependencies between elements. If elements or tasks depend on one another and must be completed in a specific order, a DAG might be involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Graph Terminology:**\n",
        "   - Pay attention to the use of terms like \"directed,\" \"acyclic,\" \"topological order,\" or \"dependencies.\" These terms are often associated with DAGs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Common Scenarios:**\n",
        "   - Some common scenarios where DAGs are used include:\n",
        "     - Task scheduling with dependencies (e.g., course prerequisites, project planning).\n",
        "     - Representing hierarchical structures without cycles (e.g., version control, build systems).\n",
        "     - Finding the longest or shortest paths in directed graphs without cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Indicators\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task Scheduling:** If the problem is about scheduling tasks where certain tasks must be completed before others, it's likely involving a DAG.\n",
        "- **Prerequisites:** If the problem involves courses with prerequisites, it implies a DAG structure to maintain the order of completion.\n",
        "- **Order of Operations:** If the problem requires you to determine an order of operations or dependencies, a DAG might be at play.\n",
        "\n",
        "By keeping an eye out for these clues and characteristics, you can identify when a problem involves a Directed Acyclic Graph. Let me know if you have any specific problems in mind, and I can help you analyze them!"

        "\n",
        "Given:\n",
        "- An `org` array representing the target sequence.\n",
        "- A list of subsequences, `seqs`, that must allow us to reconstruct the exact order in `org`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The task is to determine whether there exists a **unique sequence** that can be reconstructed from `seqs` and is identical to `org`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Using Topological Sorting\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Graph Construction**:\n",
        "   - Construct a **directed graph** from the subsequences in `seqs`, where each element in a subsequence implies an ordering between consecutive elements.\n",
        "   - Create an **in-degree** array to count incoming edges for each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Topological Sort with Unique Order Check**:\n",
        "   - Perform a topological sort on the graph:\n",
        "     - At each step, if there is more than one node with `in-degree` zero, then there is no unique way to reconstruct the sequence, and the result should be `False`.\n",
        "     - If we can uniquely determine the next element each time, we proceed.\n",
        "   - If the topological order of the sorted nodes matches `org`, then we have a unique reconstruction that matches the target sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Edge Cases**:\n",
        "   - If `seqs` is empty or has no valid information about all elements in `org`, return `False`.\n",
        "   - If any element in `org` is missing from `seqs`, reconstruction is impossible.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Graph Construction**:\n",
        "   - We create `graph`, a dictionary of lists, where each key is a node and each value is the list of nodes it points to (its successors).\n",
        "   - `in_degree` keeps track of how many edges are pointing to each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Topological Sort Using Queue**:\n",
        "   - We initialize `queue` with nodes that have zero in-degree (i.e., no dependencies).\n",
        "   - For each node:\n",
        "     - If there’s more than one node in `queue`, return `False`, as this means there is more than one possible order.\n",
        "     - Otherwise, we add the node to the `reconstructed_sequence` and decrease the in-degrees of its neighbors.\n",
        "     - If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes zero, we add it to the queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Final Check**:\n",
        "   - After constructing the sequence, we check if `reconstructed_sequence` matches `org`. If it does, the unique order requirement is met, and we return `True`.\n",
        "   - If the two sequences don’t match, return `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Complexity Analysis\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(V + E)\\), where \\(V\\) is the number of nodes in `org` and \\(E\\) is the number of edges in `seqs`.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(V + E)\\) for storing the graph and in-degree array.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures we can check for a unique topological sort that exactly matches `org`, providing an efficient solution to the problem."

        "Yes, we can solve this problem using topological sorting since the dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Topological sorting will allow us to determine a build order for the packages. Here's how you can implement it:\n",

        "### Steps for Topological Sort:\n",
        "1. **Create a graph representation of the dependencies.**\n",
