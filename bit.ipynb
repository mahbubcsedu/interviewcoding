        "Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), also known as Fenwick Tree, is a data structure that provides an efficient way to update elements and calculate prefix sums in a list of numbers. It's especially useful when you have multiple updates and queries for cumulative sums in a list, and it has a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\) for both update and query operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Binary Indexed Tree:\n",
        "1. **Structure**: BIT uses a 1-based index, meaning we start from index 1.\n",
        "2. **Updating Values**: BIT allows you to update values in \\(O(\\log n)\\) time, meaning you can add a specific value to an element.\n",
        "3. **Prefix Sum Query**: BIT provides an efficient way to calculate the prefix sum from the start to any index in \\(O(\\log n)\\) time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Operations in Binary Indexed Tree\n",
        "1. **Initialize**: Construct a BIT with all elements initialized to 0.\n",
        "2. **Update**: Update an element by adding a value to it.\n",
        "3. **Query**: Compute the sum from the beginning up to a given index.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), moving from a specific index to its ancestors (from a leaf to the root) is done using **bit manipulation** on the index. The key to navigating the BIT lies in understanding the role of **binary representation** in identifying parent and child relationships within the tree structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### BIT Structure and Binary Representation\n",
        "The BIT is organized so that each position at index `i` is responsible for storing the sum of a specific range of elements. The range covered by each index is determined by the **lowest set bit** (the rightmost 1-bit in binary) of that index. This structure enables efficient querying and updating.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Moving from a Leaf to the Root\n",
        "To compute the prefix sum or traverse from a leaf up to the root, BIT uses the following technique:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identify the Parent**: To move from an index \\( i \\) to its parent, subtract the lowest set bit of \\( i \\) from \\( i \\). In binary, this is achieved by `i -= i & -i`. This operation removes the rightmost 1-bit in \\( i \\), effectively moving up the tree.\n",
        "2. **Continue the Process**: Repeat this operation until you reach 0, which represents the root.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why This Works\n",
        "In binary terms, the `i & -i` operation isolates the rightmost 1-bit in \\( i \\). This 1-bit represents the range covered by the node at \\( i \\). By subtracting this bit, you \"jump\" up to the next ancestor node in the BIT structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Moving Up the Tree\n",
        "Let’s see an example with an index \\( i = 13 \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Binary Representation**: \\( 13 \\) in binary is `1101`.\n",
        "2. **Lowest Set Bit**: The lowest set bit of \\( 13 \\) is `0001`, which is \\( 1 \\) in decimal.\n",
        "3. **Subtract Lowest Set Bit**: Now we compute `13 - (13 & -13)`, which gives `13 - 1 = 12`.\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Next, `12` in binary is `1100`. The lowest set bit is `4`, so `12 - 4 = 8`.\n",
        "5. **Repeat Until Zero**: Next, `8` in binary is `1000`, and its lowest set bit is also `8`. Subtracting this gives `0`, which ends the traversal.\n",
        "\n",
        "By this sequence (13 → 12 → 8 → 0), we efficiently move up the BIT from index 13 to the root.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Code Example\n",
        "In BIT, a `query` function that calculates the prefix sum up to a given index can look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def query(index):\n",
        "    result = 0\n",
        "    while index > 0:\n",
        "        result += bit_tree[index]\n",
        "        index -= index & -index  # Move up to the parent\n",
        "    return result\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        "- The `index & -index` bit manipulation enables us to jump to the parent node.\n",
        "- We continue this process until `index` becomes 0, covering all relevant nodes up to the root.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "- **`index & -index`** isolates the lowest set bit, telling us the range that node covers.\n",
        "- **Subtracting this bit** moves us up the tree to the parent node in BIT.\n",
        "  \n",
        "This approach allows both update and prefix sum query operations to be completed efficiently in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time.\n",

        "### Explanation of the Code\n",
        "1. **Coordinate Compression**:\n",
        "   - We compress both `nums` and `2 * nums` to handle queries involving \\( nums[i] > 2 \\times nums[j] \\).\n",
        "   - We create a `rank_map` dictionary that maps each unique value to a unique index.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **BIT Initialization**:\n",
        "   - We initialize a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) of size equal to the number of unique compressed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reverse Iteration with Queries and Updates**:\n",
        "   - For each \\( num \\) in `nums` from right to left:\n",
        "     - **Query**: We check how many elements are present in the BIT that are less than or equal to \\( num / 2 \\) by querying the index `rank_map[num / 2]`.\n",
        "     - **Update**: After querying, we add the current \\( num \\) to the BIT using `bit.update(rank_map[num], 1)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Output**:\n",
        "   - The variable `reverse_pair_count` accumulates the result of queries and is returned as the total count of reverse pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity\n",
        "- **Coordinate Compression**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in `nums`.\n",
        "- **BIT Operations**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) for both updates and queries, as each takes \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n",
        "- **Overall Complexity**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\), making it efficient for large arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach effectively leverages BIT and coordinate compression to count reverse pairs in a time-efficient manner."
