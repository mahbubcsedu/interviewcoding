### Line Sweep Algorithm Overview

The **Line Sweep Algorithm** is a computational geometry technique used to solve problems related to intervals or regions. It is particularly effective when we need to process a collection of intervals or events in an efficient manner, typically in a sorted order. This technique is often applied in problems involving **intervals, events, or ranges** in 1D, 2D, or even higher dimensions.

The core idea is to "sweep" a vertical or horizontal line across the problem space, processing events in the order they occur, usually sorted by position or time. As the line moves, we update or maintain a set of active intervals or events, and solve the problem as the line passes through different stages.

### Key Steps of the Line Sweep Algorithm:
1. **Define Events:** The problem is first broken down into a series of events. For example, in a 2D space, these could be the starting and ending points of intervals (or rectangles).
  
2. **Sort the Events:** These events are sorted, typically by their position along the axis (for 1D problems) or a combination of positions and other properties (like time).

3. **Process Events in Order:** Once the events are sorted, the algorithm processes them in order, maintaining a set of active intervals or objects. Depending on the problem, each event might correspond to adding or removing an element from the active set.

4. **Maintain Active Set:** As the line sweeps across the space, it maintains a dynamic data structure (often a priority queue, hash set, or balanced tree) that helps in efficiently querying or updating the current state of active intervals.

5. **Answer Queries or Count Results:** The result is typically built incrementally by updating the state based on the events. For example, in computational geometry, we might need to count overlapping intervals, or in scheduling problems, we might need to count parallel tasks.

### Example of How Line Sweep Works:
For example, consider the problem of finding the number of overlapping intervals:

- **Input:** `[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]` (each tuple represents an interval with start and end times).
- **Events:** Create two types of events: starting and ending points of intervals.
    - Event 1: `(1, "start")`
    - Event 2: `(3, "end")`
    - Event 3: `(2, "start")`
    - Event 4: `(4, "end")`
    - Event 5: `(3, "start")`
    - Event 6: `(5, "end")`
  
- **Sort Events:** Sort by position. If two events have the same position, process "end" events before "start" events to handle cases of exact overlaps.
    - Sorted Events: `[(1, "start"), (2, "start"), (3, "start"), (3, "end"), (4, "end"), (5, "end")]`

- **Process Events:** Start with an empty set of active intervals. For each event:
    - Start event: Add the interval to the active set.
    - End event: Remove the interval from the active set.
    - Track the size of the active set to determine the maximum overlap.
