### Line Sweep Algorithm Overview

The **Line Sweep Algorithm** is a computational geometry technique used to solve problems related to intervals or regions. It is particularly effective when we need to process a collection of intervals or events in an efficient manner, typically in a sorted order. This technique is often applied in problems involving **intervals, events, or ranges** in 1D, 2D, or even higher dimensions.

The core idea is to "sweep" a vertical or horizontal line across the problem space, processing events in the order they occur, usually sorted by position or time. As the line moves, we update or maintain a set of active intervals or events, and solve the problem as the line passes through different stages.

### Key Steps of the Line Sweep Algorithm:
1. **Define Events:** The problem is first broken down into a series of events. For example, in a 2D space, these could be the starting and ending points of intervals (or rectangles).
  
2. **Sort the Events:** These events are sorted, typically by their position along the axis (for 1D problems) or a combination of positions and other properties (like time).

3. **Process Events in Order:** Once the events are sorted, the algorithm processes them in order, maintaining a set of active intervals or objects. Depending on the problem, each event might correspond to adding or removing an element from the active set.

4. **Maintain Active Set:** As the line sweeps across the space, it maintains a dynamic data structure (often a priority queue, hash set, or balanced tree) that helps in efficiently querying or updating the current state of active intervals.

5. **Answer Queries or Count Results:** The result is typically built incrementally by updating the state based on the events. For example, in computational geometry, we might need to count overlapping intervals, or in scheduling problems, we might need to count parallel tasks.

### Example of How Line Sweep Works:
For example, consider the problem of finding the number of overlapping intervals:

- **Input:** `[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]` (each tuple represents an interval with start and end times).
- **Events:** Create two types of events: starting and ending points of intervals.
    - Event 1: `(1, "start")`
    - Event 2: `(3, "end")`
    - Event 3: `(2, "start")`
    - Event 4: `(4, "end")`
    - Event 5: `(3, "start")`
    - Event 6: `(5, "end")`
  
- **Sort Events:** Sort by position. If two events have the same position, process "end" events before "start" events to handle cases of exact overlaps.
    - Sorted Events: `[(1, "start"), (2, "start"), (3, "start"), (3, "end"), (4, "end"), (5, "end")]`

- **Process Events:** Start with an empty set of active intervals. For each event:
    - Start event: Add the interval to the active set.
    - End event: Remove the interval from the active set.
    - Track the size of the active set to determine the maximum overlap.

The **"Count of Smaller Numbers After Self"** problem (LeetCode 315) requires you to count, for each element in an array, how many numbers to the right are smaller than that element. This problem is a great candidate for an efficient solution using **Line Sweep** and **Binary Search**.

### Problem Overview:
Given an array `nums`, for each element `nums[i]`, you need to find how many numbers to the right of `nums[i]` are smaller than `nums[i]`.

**Example:**
Input: `nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]`
Output: `[2, 1, 1, 0]`

**Explanation:**
- For `5`, the numbers smaller than it to the right are `2` and `1`. So the count is `2`.
- For `2`, the only number smaller than it to the right is `1`. So the count is `1`.
- For `6`, the number smaller than it to the right is `1`. So the count is `1`.
- For `1`, there are no numbers to the right smaller than it. So the count is `0`.

### Naive Approach:
A naive solution involves iterating through each element and checking all the elements to its right. This results in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which is inefficient for large arrays.

### Efficient Approach Using Line Sweep and Binary Search:
We can improve this problem using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** or **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)** (also called a **Fenwick Tree**). We can think of the line sweep as "sweeping" from right to left through the array while keeping track of the smaller elements seen so far.

#### Strategy:
- Start from the rightmost element.
- Maintain a dynamic list (or data structure) of elements already processed (i.e., elements to the right of the current element in the original array).
- For each element `nums[i]`, count how many elements in this list are smaller than `nums[i]`. This can be done efficiently using a **Binary Search**.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialize a Sorted Data Structure:** We will use a **SortedList** (from the `sortedcontainers` library) to maintain the elements that have been processed so far. This data structure supports binary search operations, which are ideal for this problem.
  
2. **For each element** (starting from the rightmost):
   - Use **binary search** to find the number of elements in the sorted list that are smaller than the current element.
   - Add the current element to the sorted list.
  
3. **Store the count** of elements smaller than the current element in a result array.

### Solution Code (using SortedList):

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def countSmaller(nums):
    result = []
    sorted_list = SortedList()  # This will keep the elements we have seen so far (sorted)
    
    # Traverse the nums array from right to left
    for num in reversed(nums):
        # Find the position of num in the sorted list (the count of numbers smaller than num)
        result.append(sorted_list.bisect_left(num))
        # Insert num into the sorted list
        sorted_list.add(num)
    
    # The result array is in reverse order, so reverse it to get the final result
    return result[::-1]

# Example usage
nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]
print(countSmaller(nums))  # Output: [2, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result`: This will store the count of smaller numbers for each element.
   - `sorted_list`: This is a `SortedList` that stores the elements we have seen so far, in sorted order.

2. **Reverse Iteration:**
   - We loop through the array from the last element to the first (`reversed(nums)`).
   - For each element `num`:
     - We use `bisect_left(num)` to find the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `num`. The index returned by `bisect_left(num)` represents the count of elements smaller than `num` in the `sorted_list` (since the list is sorted).
     - We append this count to the `result` array.
     - We then insert `num` into the `sorted_list` using `add(num)`.

3. **Final Result:**
   - After processing all elements, the `result` list will be in reverse order, so we return the reversed list (`result[::-1]`).

### Time Complexity:
- **Inserting into the SortedList**: Each insertion into the `SortedList` takes \(O(\log n)\).
- **Binary Search (bisect_left)**: Finding the position of `num` using binary search also takes \(O(\log n)\).
- Since we process each element once, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of the array.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we store the result array and the `SortedList`, which both grow to size \(n\).

### Example Walkthrough:

For `nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]`:

1. **Start with the last element (1):**
   - `sorted_list = []`
   - `bisect_left(1) = 0` (no elements are smaller than 1)
   - Add `1` to `sorted_list`: `sorted_list = [1]`
   - `result = [0]`

2. **Move to 6:**
   - `sorted_list = [1]`
   - `bisect_left(6) = 1` (1 element smaller than 6, which is 1)
   - Add `6` to `sorted_list`: `sorted_list = [1, 6]`
   - `result = [0, 1]`

3. **Move to 2:**
   - `sorted_list = [1, 6]`
   - `bisect_left(2) = 1` (1 element smaller than 2, which is 1)
   - Add `2` to `sorted_list`: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 6]`
   - `result = [0, 1, 1]`

4. **Move to 5:**
   - `sorted_list = [1, 2, 6]`
   - `bisect_left(5) = 2` (2 elements smaller than 5, which are 1 and 2)
   - Add `5` to `sorted_list`: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 5, 6]`
   - `result = [0, 1, 1, 2]`

Finally, reverse the result to get `[2, 1, 1, 0]`, which is the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The **Line Sweep Algorithm** combined with **Binary Search** (through a `SortedList`) provides an efficient solution to the "Count of Smaller Numbers After Self" problem. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n \log n)\), making it feasible to solve larger input sizes.

Leetcode Problem 334, **Increasing Triplet Subsequence**, asks us to determine if a given array of integers contains an increasing subsequence of length 3. The goal is to check if there exists a subsequence `i < j < k` such that `arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k]`.

### Problem Breakdown:
We need to find three numbers in the array such that:
- There exists an element smaller than the current element at position `j` before it (let's call it `first`).
- There exists an element larger than the current element at position `j` after it (let's call it `second`).

The naive approach would be to use three nested loops, which would be inefficient with a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\). However, we can solve this problem efficiently with a greedy approach using **two variables** and a single pass through the array, which is closely related to a **line sweep** strategy.

### Approach:

1. **Two variables (first, second):**
   - Let `first` be the smallest value found so far while sweeping through the array.
   - Let `second` be the smallest value greater than `first` encountered after `first`.
   
   The idea is to track the two smallest values in the array that could form an increasing triplet.

2. **Greedy Process:**
   - As we traverse the array, for each element `num`:
     - If `num` is smaller than or equal to `first`, update `first`.
     - If `num` is greater than `first` but smaller than or equal to `second`, update `second`.
     - If `num` is greater than `second`, it means we have found a triplet (`first`, `second`, and `num`), and we can return `True`.

3. **Result:**
   - If we finish iterating through the array and haven't found a triplet, return `False`.

This approach works in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the length of the array, because we make a single pass through the array and only use a constant amount of extra space.

### Solution Code:

```python
def increasingTriplet(nums):
    # Initialize first and second to infinity
    first = second = float('inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        if num <= first:
            first = num  # Update first to be the smallest value so far
        elif num <= second:
            second = num  # Update second to be the smallest value greater than first
        else:
            # If we find a number greater than both first and second, we have a triplet
            return True
    
    return False  # No triplet found

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(increasingTriplet(nums))  # Output: True

nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(increasingTriplet(nums))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `first` and `second` are initially set to infinity (`float('inf')`), representing that no valid subsequence has been found yet.

2. **Traversing the Array:**
   - For each `num` in the array, we check:
     - If `num` is less than or equal to `first`, we update `first`. This means we are looking for a potential smallest number to start an increasing subsequence.
     - If `num` is greater than `first` but less than or equal to `second`, we update `second`. This means we've found a valid second element that could form an increasing subsequence with `first`.
     - If `num` is greater than `second`, we've found a third element that completes the increasing subsequence, so we return `True`.

3. **Return Value:**
   - If we complete the loop without finding a triplet, we return `False`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the `first` and `second` variables.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Initialize: `first = inf`, `second = inf`.
- Iteration:
  - `num = 1`: `first = 1`, `second = inf`.
  - `num = 2`: `second = 2`.
  - `num = 3`: Found `num > second`, so return `True`.
  
Output: `True`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- Initialize: `first = inf`, `second = inf`.
- Iteration:
  - `num = 5`: `first = 5`, `second = inf`.
  - `num = 4`: `first = 4`, `second = inf`.
  - `num = 3`: `first = 3`, `second = inf`.
  - `num = 2`: `first = 2`, `second = inf`.
  - `num = 1`: `first = 1`, `second = inf`.
  
Output: `False`.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently checks for an increasing triplet subsequence using a greedy approach with two variables, making it ideal for large input sizes. It leverages a line sweep-like strategy where we update the smallest and second smallest values as we move through the array.

The **"My Calendar II"** problem on LeetCode involves managing overlapping bookings in a calendar. Specifically, you need to design a class `MyCalendarTwo` that supports booking events while allowing for a maximum of two overlapping events. If a new event causes three or more overlapping events, the booking must be rejected.

To solve this problem efficiently, a line sweep algorithm can be applied. The main idea behind the line sweep is to consider the "events" as intervals and sweep through the timeline, updating the number of overlapping events. Here's how we can approach this problem:

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Line Sweep Algorithm:
1. **Events as Points**: Every booking creates two events:
   - A starting point (when an event begins).
   - An ending point (when an event ends).
   
2. **Use a Sweep Line**: Instead of keeping track of every possible time slot in the calendar, we can reduce the problem to a series of events at the start and end times of the bookings.

3. **Event Sorting**: 
   - Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type)`, where `type` is `+1` for a start time and `-1` for an end time.
   - The events are sorted first by time. In case of ties (when two events happen at the same time), we prioritize ending events over starting events to handle overlaps correctly.

4. **Processing Events**: 
   - As we "sweep" through the sorted events, we maintain a counter for the number of active bookings. 
   - If the number of active bookings exceeds 2 at any point, we reject the booking.

### Code Implementation:
```python
class MyCalendarTwo:

    def __init__(self):
        # A list to store the events as (time, type), where type is +1 for start and -1 for end.
        self.events = []
        

    def book(self, startTime: int, endTime: int) -> bool:
        # Add the start and end events to the list of events.
        self.events.append((startTime, 1))  # start of the event
        self.events.append((endTime, -1))   # end of the event
        temp = self.events.copy()

        # Sort the events first by time, and if times are the same, by type (-1 should come before +1)
        temp.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

        active = 0  # This will keep track of the number of active overlapping events
        for time, type in temp:
            active += type  # Update active count
            if active > 2:  # If there are more than 2 overlapping events
                # Revert the changes (remove this booking), problem here is we already sorted
                self.events.pop()  # Remove the end event we just added
                self.events.pop()  # Remove the start event we just added
                return False  # Reject the booking
        return True  # Accept the booking
```

### Explanation:
1. **Constructor (`__init__`)**: 
   - Initializes an empty list `self.events` to store the events in the form of tuples (time, type).
   
2. **Book Function (`book`)**:
   - When a new booking is requested from `start` to `end`, we add two events:
     - A `start` event (represented as `(start, 1)`).
     - An `end` event (represented as `(end, -1)`).
   - The events are sorted by their time. If two events have the same time, the end event is processed before the start event to ensure we handle the end of one event and the start of another correctly.
   - The `active` variable tracks how many events are currently active (overlapping). If, at any point, the number of active events exceeds 2, we undo the changes and return `False` to reject the booking.
   - If no conflicts are found, the booking is accepted, and we return `True`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting the Events**: Sorting the events takes `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of events in the list.
- **Processing Events**: Iterating through the events takes `O(N)`.
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N log N)` for each booking operation.

This approach efficiently handles the problem by focusing on events and sorting them, making it scalable even for larger inputs.
