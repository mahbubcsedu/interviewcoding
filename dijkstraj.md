## Dijstraj algorithm
Hereâ€™s an overview of Dijkstra's algorithm and resources to study it further, including problems that can be efficiently solved using the technique:

### **Dijkstra's Algorithm Overview**
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, assuming all edge weights are non-negative. It uses a **priority queue** (min-heap) to always explore the nearest unvisited node. The algorithm is greedy and works by iteratively relaxing edges to update the shortest known distances to neighboring nodes.

Key points:
1. **Initialization**: Set the distance to the source node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.
2. **Priority Queue**: Use it to retrieve the node with the smallest known distance.
3. **Relaxation**: For each neighbor, check if going through the current node provides a shorter path and update if so.
4. **Termination**: Stop when all nodes have been processed or when the queue is empty.

### **Problems for Practice**
Here are some **medium and hard-level problems** where Dijkstra's algorithm is applicable:
1. **Network Delay Time** ([LeetCode 743](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time)): Find the time it takes for all nodes to receive a signal sent from a starting node.
2. **Path With Minimum Effort** ([LeetCode 1631](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort)): Find the path with the smallest effort in a weighted grid.
3. **The Maze II** ([LeetCode 505](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-ii)): Find the shortest distance for a ball to stop at the destination in a maze.
4. **Cheapest Flights Within K Stops** ([LeetCode 787](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops)): Find the cheapest flight route with up to K stops.
5. **Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance** ([LeetCode 1334](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance)).

For additional challenges and solutions, refer to the following tutorials:
- A comprehensive implementation walkthrough on **FreeCodeCamp** provides examples with visual aids ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/)).
- An in-depth guide with pseudocode and use cases on **CP-Algorithms** ([source](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/dijkstra.html)).

### **Code Implementation**
Below is an example of implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

    while priority_queue:
        d, node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        if d > dist[node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            new_dist = d + weight
            if new_dist < dist[neighbor]:
                dist[neighbor] = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (new_dist, neighbor))
    
    return dist
```

This function assumes `graph` is an adjacency list, where `graph[u]` contains `(v, weight)` tuples representing neighbors of node `u`.
