        "### Explanation of Python Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Conversion**:\n",
        "   - We convert `S` and `T` into lists `s` and `t` to easily access individual characters by index.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `res` holds the result string for the smallest window.\n",
        "   - `i` is the pointer used to traverse string `S`.\n",
        "   - `tindex` is the pointer used to track the position in string `T`.\n",
        "   - `slen` and `tlen` are the lengths of strings `S` and `T` respectively.\n",
        "   - `min_len` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) to track the length of the smallest valid window.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sliding Window Logic**:\n",
        "   - We iterate over `S` using the pointer `i`.\n",
        "   - For each character in `S`, we check if it matches the current character in `T` (tracked by `tindex`).\n",
        "   - When all characters of `T` are matched (`tindex == tlen`), we calculate the window and try to shrink it by moving `i` backward to find the starting index of the smallest window.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Window Shrinking**:\n",
        "   - After finding a match for all characters of `T`, we backtrack and find the smallest possible window that still contains `T` as a subsequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Result**:\n",
        "   - After processing the string, if a valid window was found, `res` will contain the smallest window, otherwise, it returns an empty string.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity:\n",
        "- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of string `S`. We only iterate over `S` once, and each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Edge Cases:\n",
        "- If `T` is longer than `S`, the result will be an empty string since it's impossible to find a subsequence.\n",
        "- If `T` is empty, the result will also be an empty string since there's nothing to match.\n",
