Monotonic queues are useful data structures that help solve problems requiring the minimum or maximum of a sliding window over an array in an efficient way. The queue maintains elements in a specific order (either increasing or decreasing) as you iterate through the array, making it efficient to access the min or max values in \(O(1)\) time.

Here are some LeetCode problems that are well-suited for practicing the monotonic queue concept.

### Problems Using Monotonic Queue

#### 1. [Sliding Window Maximum (LeetCode #239)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)
   - **Problem**: Given an array `nums` and a window size `k`, return an array of the maximum values in each sliding window.
   - **Solution**: Use a monotonic decreasing queue to store indices of `nums`, ensuring the largest element of each window is always at the front of the queue. This enables efficient max queries within each window.

#### 2. [Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K (LeetCode #862)](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/)
   - **Problem**: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the shortest non-empty subarray with a sum at least `k`.
   - **Solution**: Use a prefix sum array and a monotonic queue to maintain potential starting points of the shortest subarray. A monotonic queue helps by storing indices where the prefix sum values are increasing, allowing efficient range sum checks for the shortest subarray.

#### 3. [Minimum Window Subsequence (LeetCode #727)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-subsequence/)
   - **Problem**: Given strings `S` and `T`, find the minimum window in `S` that contains `T` as a subsequence.
   - **Solution**: Although not a sliding window maximum/minimum problem directly, using a deque can help maintain potential subsequences efficiently, by keeping track of minimal windows while ensuring increasing order for certain comparisons.

#### 4. [Constrained Subsequence Sum (LeetCode #1425)](https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/)
   - **Problem**: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that for every two consecutive elements in the subsequence, the absolute difference in their indices is at most `k`.
   - **Solution**: Use a monotonic deque to maintain the maximum of the previous `k` values, allowing efficient calculation of the maximum sum within the constrained window.

#### 5. [Longest Continuous Subarray with Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit (LeetCode #1438)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/)
   - **Problem**: Find the longest subarray in which the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to `limit`.
   - **Solution**: Use two monotonic queues (one for the maximum values and one for the minimum values) to keep track of the current window. Adjust the window size dynamically based on whether the difference exceeds the limit, maintaining the invariant of the longest subarray that satisfies the condition.

#### 6. [Max Sliding Window Sum with a Twist (LeetCode #1696)](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vi/)
   - **Problem**: You are jumping across an array, with each jump adding or subtracting from your score based on array values. Find the maximum possible score you can achieve given that you can jump a maximum of `k` steps forward.
   - **Solution**: Use a monotonic queue to keep track of the best scores within each possible jump window. As you progress, the queue helps find the optimal path by efficiently retrieving the max score achievable within each jump constraint.

#### 7. [Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array (LeetCode #1671)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-removals-to-make-mountain-array/)
   - **Problem**: Given an array, determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array a mountain (increasing to a peak, then decreasing).
   - **Solution**: This problem requires a bit of dynamic programming, but a monotonic queue can help find peaks and manage subarrays for each side of the peak efficiently.

### Tips for Using Monotonic Queues

1. **Keep Only Relevant Elements**: For both maximum and minimum queries, remove elements that fall out of the current window from the queue.
2. **Maintain Order**: Use a monotonic decreasing queue for maximums and a monotonic increasing queue for minimums.
3. **Consider Double Queues**: For problems with both max and min constraints, using two queues simultaneously can help maintain both conditions efficiently.

### Practice Strategy

1. **Start with Sliding Window Maximum**: This is the classic monotonic queue problem and will help you get comfortable with basic operations.
2. **Work Through Sum Constraints**: Problems like "Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K" add complexity by involving range sums, making them a good next step.
3. **Tackle Constraint and Jump Problems**: "Constrained Subsequence Sum" and "Jump Game VI" require careful management of subsequences within constraints, solidifying your understanding of maintaining queues over varying ranges. 

With these problems, you'll gain a strong grasp of the monotonic queue technique and how it helps optimize sliding window and constraint-based scenarios.

The **Monotonic Queue** is a useful data structure, often applied to sliding window problems, where we need to maintain the order of elements while efficiently answering queries based on their relationships (such as minimum or maximum values). This is particularly useful when we want to track maximum or minimum values over a sliding window of size \( k \) in an array, among other things. It allows for efficient updates as we move the window.

### Key Scenarios for Using a Monotonic Queue:
1. **Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum**: The most common problem for a monotonic queue is to find the maximum or minimum element in a sliding window of size \( k \).
2. **Range Queries**: Problems where you need to compute the maximum, minimum, or other aggregate properties over a sliding window.
3. **Keep Track of Relative Order**: When maintaining an order (ascending or descending) among elements in a sequence as you move a window across the array.

### Key Operations of a Monotonic Queue:
- **Push**: Insert an element into the queue while maintaining its monotonic property.
- **Pop**: Remove elements from the queue that are no longer relevant (out of the window or don't meet the monotonic order).
- **Front**: Peek at the first element, which holds the desired property (maximum or minimum).

The monotonic queue can either be:
- **Monotonically increasing** (where the front holds the smallest element).
- **Monotonically decreasing** (where the front holds the largest element).

### Example Problems Solved Using a Monotonic Queue:

#### Problem 1: **Sliding Window Maximum**
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and an integer \( k \), find the maximum element in each sliding window of size \( k \).

**Approach**:
- Use a **monotonically decreasing** queue where the front of the queue always holds the largest element in the window.
- As you slide the window, remove elements from the back of the queue if they are smaller than the current element (because they will never be the maximum as long as the current element exists).
- Remove elements from the front if they are outside the current window.
  
#### Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def sliding_window_max(nums, k):
    dq = deque()
    res = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove elements not within the window
        if dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()

        # Remove smaller elements as they won't be needed
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
            dq.pop()

        dq.append(i)

        # The first element in the deque is the largest for the current window
        if i >= k - 1:
            res.append(nums[dq[0]])

    return res

# Example usage:
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
k = 3
print(sliding_window_max(nums, k))
```

**Explanation**:
- We maintain a deque where each element is the index of the original array, and we make sure that the elements in the deque are always in decreasing order.
- As we slide the window, we remove elements from the deque that are out of bounds (i.e., their indices are less than \( i - k + 1 \)).
- The maximum element for the current window will always be at the front of the deque.

**Output**:
```
[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
```

#### Problem 2: **Sliding Window Minimum**
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and an integer \( k \), find the minimum element in each sliding window of size \( k \).

**Approach**:
- Use a **monotonically increasing** queue where the front of the queue always holds the smallest element in the window.
- Similarly to the maximum problem, you maintain the window by removing elements that are out of bounds and adjusting the queue to always have elements in increasing order.

#### Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def sliding_window_min(nums, k):
    dq = deque()
    res = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove elements not within the window
        if dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()

        # Remove elements from the back if they are larger than the current element
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] > nums[i]:
            dq.pop()

        dq.append(i)

        # Once the window is fully formed, add the result (minimum)
        if i >= k - 1:
            res.append(nums[dq[0]])

    return res

# Example usage:
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
k = 3
print(sliding_window_min(nums, k))
```

**Explanation**:
- We maintain a deque where each element is the index of the array, and we ensure that elements in the deque are in increasing order.
- As we slide the window, we remove indices that are out of the current window and maintain the smallest element at the front of the deque.

**Output**:
```
[-1, -3, -3, -3, 3, 3]
```

#### Problem 3: **Maximum of K-Length Subarrays with sum less than or equal to X**
**Problem**: Given an array and an integer \( X \), find the maximum length of a subarray (of at most size \( k \)) such that the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \( X \).

**Approach**:
- This problem can be solved using a sliding window approach where we maintain a current window of elements whose sum is less than or equal to \( X \).
- We use a deque to maintain the indices of elements in such a way that we can efficiently compute the sum within a window of size at most \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The monotonic queue is a powerful tool when you need to efficiently maintain and update a set of values (like minimum or maximum) over a sliding window. Its most typical use cases include problems like **sliding window max/min**, **range queries**, and **window-based dynamic programming** problems.

If you want to dive deeper into monotonic queue problems or have a specific one in mind, feel free to ask!

The **"K Empty Slots"** problem is a classic problem that involves finding two indices in an array representing flowers that bloom on different days, such that there are exactly `k` empty slots between them. The problem can be solved using a **monotonic queue**, but a more suitable data structure here is a **monotonic deque** or just a **sliding window** approach, because we need to track the indices of the blooming flowers and ensure that the distance between them meets the required conditions.

Let’s break it down and solve it step-by-step.

### Problem Statement:
You have an array `flowers` where each index represents a day, and `flowers[i] = day` means the flower at index `i` blooms on the given `day`. Your task is to find two flowers such that there are exactly `k` empty slots between them. If there is no such pair, return `-1`.

### Key Observations:
- We are interested in **tracking the blooming flowers** while also ensuring that there are exactly `k` empty slots between any two blooming flowers.
- We can solve this problem using a **monotonic deque** to maintain the flower bloom days and efficiently compute the conditions for exactly `k` empty slots.

### Approach:
1. **Use a deque to store the indices of flowers**: The idea is to track the days on which flowers bloom. We will scan the array from left to right, adding blooming flowers to the deque.
2. **Check the difference between blooming flowers**: Whenever a flower blooms, check if the previous flower in the deque satisfies the condition of having exactly `k` empty slots in between.
3. **Keep removing invalid candidates**: If any flower blooms and its index is too far away (greater than `k+1` slots), remove the elements from the front of the deque.

### Solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def kEmptySlots(flowers, k):
    # We will use a deque to track the blooming flowers
    n = len(flowers)
    days = [0] * n
    
    # Step 1: Initialize a list where the flowers bloom
    for i in range(n):
        days[flowers[i] - 1] = i  # flowers[i] tells the day a flower blooms
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the deque
    dq = deque()
    
    # Step 3: Traverse each day
    for i in range(n):
        # Remove flowers from deque that are out of the window
        while dq and days[dq[-1]] > days[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        # Add current day's index to the deque
        dq.append(i)
        
        # Step 4: Check if there are k empty slots
        if len(dq) > 1:
            if dq[0] == dq[-1] + k:
                return dq[-1]
        
    return -1  # return -1 if no solution is found
```
