## Difference array technique in solving problem

The **difference array** is a useful technique for efficiently applying range updates to an array. It’s particularly helpful when you have multiple updates to a range of elements in an array and want to apply them quickly without iterating over each range multiple times. Instead of directly updating all elements within a range, the difference array allows for efficient cumulative updates that can later be computed in linear time.

Here are some typical problems and variations that can be solved using the difference array technique:

### 1. **Range Increment Operations**
   - **Problem**: Given an array of zeros, apply multiple updates where each update increments all elements within a specified range by a given value. Return the final array after applying all updates.
   - **Example Problem**: "Range Addition" - You are given a list of operations on an initially zeroed array, where each operation specifies a range to be incremented by a value. After all operations, return the final array.

### 2. **Range Addition Queries on a Mutable Array**
   - **Problem**: Given an array with some initial values, perform multiple range increment operations on it and answer queries about the final array state.
   - **Example Problem**: "Applying Multiple Range Updates to an Array" - Similar to the problem above, but with an initial non-zero array.

### 3. **Finding Array After Multiple Range Set Operations**
   - **Problem**: Instead of incrementing, set a specified range in an array to a particular value. This can be achieved with a difference array by carefully resetting values at specific positions.
   - **Example Problem**: "Setting Elements in Range to a Value" - Implement a system where each operation sets all elements within a specified range to a given value, and return the final array.

### 4. **Range XOR Operation**
   - **Problem**: Given an array of zeros, apply multiple updates where each update toggles (XORs) all elements within a specified range by a given value. This is achievable with a difference array by using the XOR operation instead of addition.
   - **Example Problem**: "Range XOR Queries" - Apply XOR to a given range repeatedly and determine the result array after all operations.

### 5. **Prefix Sum or Cumulative Sum Queries with Range Updates**
   - **Problem**: Given an array, perform multiple range increment or decrement operations, and then answer prefix sum or cumulative sum queries.
   - **Example Problem**: "Range Increment Queries with Prefix Sum" - Efficiently compute prefix sums on an array after multiple range increment operations.

### 6. **Range Product Updates with Multiplication**
   - **Problem**: Given an array initialized with ones, apply multiple range updates where each update multiplies all elements within a specified range by a given factor.
   - **Example Problem**: "Range Multiplication Operations" - Apply multiplicative updates to a range and compute the final product array.

### 7. **Applying Interval Markers or Flags**
   - **Problem**: Mark ranges with a specific value in an initially empty (zeroed) array. This is useful for segmenting an array into marked intervals.
   - **Example Problem**: "Flagging Intervals" - For each operation, mark all elements in a specified range with a flag value and determine the final markings.

### Examples of Algorithms and Applications
The difference array technique can be applied to various algorithms, including:
   - **Sweeping Line Algorithms**: Useful for event-based range updates.
   - **2D Difference Array**: Extending difference arrays to 2D matrices to handle range updates on submatrices.
   - **Cumulative Processing**: Often used in competitive programming problems where you need cumulative range updates and/or cumulative queries.

Each of these problems leverages the core concept of the difference array to avoid direct range updates, instead marking boundaries and using a prefix sum (or analogous cumulative process) to efficiently compute final results.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a technique called **difference array**. Instead of updating all elements between `startIdxi` and `endIdxi` directly, which could be slow, we mark the start and end of the increments using a difference array approach. This reduces the time complexity to \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(m\) is the number of updates.

Here’s how it works:

1. For each update `[startIdx, endIdx, inc]`:
   - Add `inc` to `arr[startIdx]`.
   - Subtract `inc` from `arr[endIdx + 1]` (if `endIdx + 1` is within bounds).
   
   This means that all elements from `startIdx` to `endIdx` will effectively have `inc` added to them after we apply a prefix sum in the final step.

2. After all updates are applied, iterate through the array to calculate the final values using a prefix sum. This will give the result after all increments have been accounted for.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
def getModifiedArray(length, updates):
    # Step 1: Initialize the array with zeros
    arr = [0] * length
    
    # Step 2: Apply each update in the difference array manner
    for startIdx, endIdx, inc in updates:
        arr[startIdx] += inc
        if endIdx + 1 < length:
            arr[endIdx + 1] -= inc
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the final values using a prefix sum
    for i in range(1, length):
        arr[i] += arr[i - 1]
    
    return arr
```

### Explanation:

- **Step 1** initializes an array of length `length` with zeros.
- **Step 2** applies each update by marking increments at the `startIdx` and decrements at `endIdx + 1`.
- **Step 3** uses a prefix sum to accumulate the effects of the updates.

### Example:

```python
length = 5
updates = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3], [0, 2, -2]]
print(getModifiedArray(length, updates))
```

**Explanation**:
1. After applying `[1, 3, 2]`, `arr` becomes `[0, 2, 0, 0, -2]`.
2. After applying `[2, 4, 3]`, `arr` becomes `[0, 2, 3, 0, -2]`.
3. After applying `[0, 2, -2]`, `arr` becomes `[-2, 0, 1, 0, -2]`.
4. Applying the prefix sum gives the final array: `[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]`.

The output would be:
```python
[-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
```
