        "**Hierholzer's Algorithm** is used to find an **[Eulerian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path)** or **Eulerian circuit** in a directed or undirected graph. An **Eulerian circuit** is a path that visits every edge of the graph exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex. An **Eulerian path** visits every edge exactly once but does not necessarily start and end at the same vertex.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm, developed by Carl Hierholzer in 1873, efficiently finds an Eulerian path or circuit in a graph, provided that the graph satisfies the conditions for existence:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For an Eulerian Circuit**:\n",
        "  - The graph must be connected.\n",
        "  - All vertices must have an even degree.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For an Eulerian Path** (but not necessarily a circuit):\n",
        "  - The graph must be connected.\n",
        "  - Exactly two vertices must have an odd degree, or all vertices must have an even degree (in the case of a circuit, this condition is the same).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps for Hierholzer's Algorithm:\n",
        "1. **Start with a vertex** that has an unused edge. If the graph has an Eulerian circuit, any vertex will work. If it has an Eulerian path, you must start at one of the two vertices with an odd degree.\n",
        "2. **Follow a trail** of edges, taking each edge exactly once, until you reach a vertex where there are no unused edges.\n",
        "3. **Backtrack** to a vertex that has unused edges, and repeat the process, adding each new path to your Eulerian path/circuit.\n",
        "4. **If there are still unused edges** in the graph when you finish a trail, go back to the vertex where you left off and continue following unused edges until you find another unused edge to explore.\n",
        "5. **The final trail is your Eulerian Path or Circuit**. If you are looking for an Eulerian circuit, the path will start and end at the same vertex. If it is an Eulerian path, it will start at one odd-degree vertex and end at the other.\n",

The arrangement should include all the pairs, and it should be a valid Eulerian path if possible.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Graph Construction**:  \n",
        "   We build a directed graph using a defaultdict of deques where each key is a node, and the value is a deque of adjacent nodes. We also track the in-degree and out-degree of each node using `defaultdict(int)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Starting Point**:  \n",
        "   We check the difference between the out-degree and in-degree for each node:\n",
        "   - If the difference is `1`, that node will be the start of the Eulerian path.\n",
        "   - If no such node exists, any node with outgoing edges can be the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hierholzer's Algorithm**:  \n",
        "   - We start from the `start_node` and use a stack to traverse the graph.\n",
        "   - If the current node has outgoing edges, we take the next available edge and push the destination onto the stack.\n",
        "   - When we reach a node with no outgoing edges, we backtrack, adding nodes to the path.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reconstruction of the Arrangement**:  \n",
        "   After collecting the nodes in the order of traversal (using stack and backtracking), we reverse the path and convert it into the final result (pairs of consecutive nodes).\n",
        "\n",

        "The problem asks you to reconstruct a list of flight paths using a set of tickets, where each ticket is a directed edge from one airport (represented by a string) to another airport. The goal is to reconstruct the sequence of flights, starting from \"JFK\" (the initial airport) and using all tickets exactly once to form an Eulerian path.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement:\n",
        "You are given a list of airline tickets where each ticket is a pair of strings `[from, to]`, representing a flight from airport `from` to airport `to`. Your task is to reconstruct the flight itinerary in the correct order, starting from \"JFK\", such that:\n",
        "\n",

        "- The itinerary should be constructed such that you follow the rules of **Hierholzer's Algorithm** for finding an Eulerian path in a directed graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Eulerian Path**: An Eulerian path is a path in a directed graph that visits every edge exactly once. For a directed graph to have an Eulerian path, the graph must satisfy the following conditions:\n",

        "  3. **All other vertices** should have equal in-degree and out-degree.\n",

        "### Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
        "   - Treat each airport as a vertex, and each ticket as a directed edge from the source airport to the destination airport.\n",
        "   - Use a `graph` (implemented as a dictionary) to store each airport’s outgoing flights (i.e., adjacency list). A `deque` or list can be used to maintain the destinations in lexicographical order (because we need the lexicographically smallest route).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Degree Tracking**:\n",
        "   - Track the in-degree and out-degree for each vertex (airport). This helps us determine the start and end nodes, though in this problem, we know that the start node is always \"JFK\".\n",
