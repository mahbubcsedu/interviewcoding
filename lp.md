**Answer:**

Yes, I have received critical feedback that has greatly influenced my approach to project management and teamwork.

For instance, I was working on a project with two other engineers. As we progressed, it became clear that we needed additional resources to meet our deadline. However, I believed that onboarding a new team member would take more time than completing the work ourselves, so I decided to push forward with the existing team. While we successfully finished the project on time, my manager gave me critical feedback afterward. They pointed out that for larger projects, it's essential to onboard additional team members to distribute the workload more effectively, rather than increasing the burden on a smaller team. This is because there's a limit to how much workload individuals can handle, and it can impact overall productivity and team morale.

Additionally, my manager emphasized the importance of involving junior engineers in such projects, as it provides them with valuable learning opportunities and helps them grow.

I took this feedback to heart and have since made a conscious effort to involve more team members in larger projects. I've found that distributing the workload not only ensures timely completion but also fosters a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute and learn. This experience has also improved my ability to mentor junior engineers, helping them develop their skills and become valuable assets to the team.
