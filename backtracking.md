## Backtracking
A backtracking template can provide a structured approach to solve problems involving recursive exploration. Below is a flexible template in Python that you can modify for various backtracking problems.

```python
def backtrack(state, options):
    # Base Case: If the current state is a solution, add it to results or process it
    if is_solution(state):
        process_solution(state)
        return
    
    # Recursive Case: Try each option and explore further
    for option in options:
        if is_valid(option, state):  # Check if the option is valid for the current state
            state.add(option)  # Make a choice by modifying the current state
            backtrack(state, update_options(options, option))  # Explore further with updated state/options
            state.remove(option)  # Undo the choice (backtrack)

def is_solution(state):
    # Check if the current state represents a valid solution
    # Example: For subsets, check if the subset meets certain criteria
    pass

def process_solution(state):
    # Process or store the solution if required
    # Example: Append a copy of the state to a results list
    pass

def is_valid(option, state):
    # Check if the option can be added to the current state without violating constraints
    # Example: For placing queens, check if a position is not under attack
    pass

def update_options(options, option):
    # Update the list of options based on the current choice
    # Example: Exclude used elements or update a range
    pass
```

### Explanation of Each Function

- **`backtrack(state, options)`**:
  - This function represents the recursive exploration. It updates `state` with an `option`, explores further recursively, and then undoes the choice (backtracking).
  
- **`is_solution(state)`**:
  - This checks if the current `state` represents a complete and valid solution.
  
- **`process_solution(state)`**:
  - This function processes or stores the solution once a valid `state` is found.

- **`is_valid(option, state)`**:
  - This checks if adding an `option` to the `state` is valid based on problem constraints.
  
- **`update_options(options, option)`**:
  - This generates or filters new options for the next recursive call, which helps in reducing redundant computations.

### Example Usage of Template: Generating All Subsets

Here’s how you might use this template to solve a backtracking problem like generating all subsets:

```python
def subsets(nums):
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, subset):
        result.append(list(subset))  # Process the current subset (solution)

        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            subset.append(nums[i])  # Make a choice
            backtrack(i + 1, subset)  # Recurse with remaining elements
            subset.pop()  # Undo the choice (backtrack)
    
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result

# Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(subsets(nums))  # Outputs: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

### Tips for Using This Template

- **Base Case**: Always start by identifying the base case or stopping condition.
- **Backtracking Step**: Make sure to undo changes made to the state before moving to the next option.
- **Optimize `is_valid` Checks**: Using constraints in `is_valid` can prune unnecessary branches, improving performance.

- **Combine with Other Techniques**: Some backtracking problems benefit from optimizations with dynamic programming or memoization (e.g., partitioning problems).
- **Experiment with Constraints**: Notice how constraints (like "no duplicates" or "sorted output") change the nature of the backtracking approach.
