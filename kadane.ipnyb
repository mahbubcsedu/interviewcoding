To solve this problem efficiently, we need to follow a structured approach to avoid directly constructing a very large array by repeating it multiple times, which would be computationally expensive.

### Approach:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We're asked to repeat the array `arr` a total of `k` times.
   - We need to find the maximum subarray sum in the new modified array, but we also want to avoid explicitly constructing the large array, as that would be inefficient when `k` is large.
   
2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The problem asks to return the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), so we'll use modular arithmetic for the final answer.
   
3. **Key Insights:**
   - Repeating an array `arr` multiple times essentially means you have the same subarrays repeated multiple times, so we can break the problem down into finding the maximum subarray sum by considering:
     1. The maximum subarray sum **within a single copy of `arr`**.
     2. The maximum subarray sum **that might span across the boundary of two adjacent copies of `arr`**.
     3. The maximum subarray sum **across multiple copies** of `arr` (if `k > 2`).

### Step-by-step Plan:

1. **Calculate the Maximum Subarray Sum in One Array:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum for a single copy of `arr`.

2. **Calculate the Prefix and Suffix Sums:**
   - Compute the prefix sum (`max_prefix_sum`) and suffix sum (`max_suffix_sum`) of the array `arr`. These will help us determine the sum of subarrays that span across the boundaries between copies of the array.

3. **Handle Special Case for Large `k`:**
   - If `k == 1`, the result is simply the maximum subarray sum of `arr` itself.
   - If `k == 2`, consider the possibility of subarrays that span across the boundary of two consecutive copies of `arr`.
   - If `k > 2`, the maximum subarray can involve multiple copies of `arr`. Specifically, the sum can include:
     - The best prefix of the first array.
     - The best suffix of the last array.
     - The sum of the full arrays in the middle, if any, where the total sum of these arrays is positive.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The maximum subarray sum for `k >= 2` can be computed as the maximum of:
     1. The best sum inside a single array.
     2. The sum of the suffix of the first array, the prefix of the last array, and potentially the sum of all arrays in between if `k > 2`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def maxSubarraySum(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Step 1: Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in one array
    def kadane(arr):
        max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
        for num in arr:
            max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
        return max_so_far

    # Step 2: Calculate prefix sum, suffix sum, and total sum of the array
    max_sum_single = kadane(arr)  # max subarray sum in one copy of arr
    prefix_sum = suffix_sum = total_sum = 0
    max_prefix_sum = max_suffix_sum = 0
    
    # Calculate the prefix and suffix sums and the total sum
    for num in arr:
        total_sum += num
        prefix_sum += num
        max_prefix_sum = max(max_prefix_sum, prefix_sum)
    
    for num in reversed(arr):
        suffix_sum += num
        max_suffix_sum = max(max_suffix_sum, suffix_sum)
    
    # Step 3: Determine the result based on the value of k
    if k == 1:
        return max_sum_single % MOD
    elif k == 2:
        return max(max_sum_single, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum) % MOD
    else:
        # If k >= 3, consider the possibility of subarrays spanning multiple arrays
        # Case: The max of 1 or 2 arrays
        result = max(max_sum_single, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum)
        # Case: Consider the sum from multiple arrays (if total_sum is positive)
        if total_sum > 0:
            result = max(result, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum + (k - 2) * total_sum)
        return result % MOD

```

### Explanation:

1. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - `kadane(arr)` finds the maximum subarray sum in a single array, which is essential for `k = 1` and as a base case when considering boundary sums for `k >= 2`.
   
2. **Prefix, Suffix, and Total Sums:**
   - `max_prefix_sum`: The maximum sum of a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array.
   - `max_suffix_sum`: The maximum sum of a subarray that ends at the end of the array.
   - `total_sum`: The sum of all elements in the array, useful when considering multiple copies of the array for `k >= 3`.

3. **Handling `k = 1`, `k = 2`, and `k > 2`:**
   - For `k = 1`, return the maximum subarray sum in one copy of the array.
   - For `k = 2`, check both the maximum subarray within a single array and the sum of subarrays that span across two arrays.
   - For `k > 2`, if the total sum is positive, consider subarrays that span multiple arrays and calculate the possible maximum by adding the contributions from the middle arrays.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because Kadane's algorithm and the calculations for prefix/suffix sums both take linear time.

### Example:

Given `arr = [1, 2]` and `k = 3`:

- The maximum subarray sum within a single array is `3` (from `1 + 2`).
- The maximum prefix sum is `1` (from the first element).
- The maximum suffix sum is `2` (from the last element).
- The total sum of the array is `3`.

For `k = 3`, the maximum subarray sum could be:
- `max(3, 1 + 2 + (3 - 2) * 3) = max(3, 7) = 7`.

Thus, the result is `7 % (10^9 + 7) = 7`.

## Another example
Certainly! Let's walk through the solution using a larger array to illustrate the process. We'll take the array `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4]` and set `k = 3`.

### Input:
- `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4]`
- `k = 3`

### Step 1: Find the maximum subarray sum for a single copy of the array (`arr`)

We will apply **Kadane's algorithm** to the array `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4]` to find the maximum subarray sum in one copy of the array.

- Initialize `max_ending_here = 0` and `max_so_far = 0`.
- Traverse the array:
  - First element is `1`:
    - `max_ending_here = max(1, 0 + 1) = 1`
    - `max_so_far = max(0, 1) = 1`
  - Second element is `-2`:
    - `max_ending_here = max(-2, 1 + (-2)) = -1`
    - `max_so_far = max(1, -1) = 1`
  - Third element is `3`:
    - `max_ending_here = max(3, -1 + 3) = 3`
    - `max_so_far = max(1, 3) = 3`
  - Fourth element is `4`:
    - `max_ending_here = max(4, 3 + 4) = 7`
    - `max_so_far = max(3, 7) = 7`

Thus, the maximum subarray sum in one copy of the array is **7**.

### Step 2: Calculate the prefix sum, suffix sum, and total sum of `arr`

- **Prefix sum**: This is the maximum sum of a subarray starting from the beginning of the array.
  - For `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4]`, the prefix sums are:
    - Start with `0` and add each element.
    - `prefix_sum = [1, -1, 2, 6]` → `max_prefix_sum = max(1, -1, 2, 6) = 6`

- **Suffix sum**: This is the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the last element of the array.
  - For `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4]`, the suffix sums are:
    - Start with `0` and add each element in reverse.
    - `suffix_sum = [4, 7, 5, 3]` → `max_suffix_sum = max(4, 7, 5, 3) = 7`

- **Total sum**: The sum of all elements in `arr`.
  - `total_sum = 1 + (-2) + 3 + 4 = 6`

### Step 3: Handle different values of `k`

- **Case 1: If `k = 1`**
  - We already know from Step 1 that the maximum subarray sum in a single copy of `arr` is **7**.
  - So, if `k = 1`, the result is `7`.

- **Case 2: If `k = 2`**
  - We need to consider both the maximum subarray sum inside one array (`max_sum_single = 7`) and the maximum sum of a subarray that spans across two copies of `arr`. 
  - For this, we consider the maximum suffix sum from the first copy of `arr` and the maximum prefix sum from the second copy of `arr`:
    - `max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum = 7 + 6 = 13`
  - So, the maximum subarray sum when `k = 2` is:
    - `max(max_sum_single, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum) = max(7, 13) = 13`

- **Case 3: If `k >= 3`**
  - For `k = 3`, we also need to consider subarrays that span across multiple copies of `arr`. Since `k > 2`, we can potentially add the full arrays in the middle (if their total sum is positive).
  - We already know the total sum of `arr` is `6`. 
  - The maximum subarray sum for `k = 3` can be calculated as:
    - `max(max_sum_single, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum, max_suffix_sum + max_prefix_sum + (k - 2) * total_sum)`
    - Substituting the values:
      - `max(7, 13, 7 + 6 + (3 - 2) * 6) = max(7, 13, 7 + 6 + 6) = max(7, 13, 19)`
  - So, the maximum subarray sum for `k = 3` is **19**.

### Step 4: Final Answer

- The final result, when `k = 3`, is **19**, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). Since 19 is less than \( 10^9 + 7 \), we simply return **19**.

### Final Answer:
The result for this example is **19**.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Find the maximum subarray sum for a single copy of `arr` using Kadane's algorithm.
2. Calculate the prefix sum, suffix sum, and total sum of `arr`.
3. Depending on the value of `k`, calculate the result by considering:
   - The maximum subarray sum in one copy (`k = 1`).
   - The maximum subarray sum when the subarray spans across two copies (`k = 2`).
   - The possibility of subarrays spanning multiple copies when `k >= 3`, utilizing the total sum of `arr`.

This approach ensures that we do not explicitly build the large array, and it efficiently computes the result in linear time, \( O(n) \).
