        "I started my DP journey by participating in the monthly challenges for April and May, which helped build a daily problem-solving habit. By systematically working through the problems, categorizing them, and exploring the most common dynamic programming patterns, I gradually built my understanding. I hope this categorization helps others who are working to master DP."
