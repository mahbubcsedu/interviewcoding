### **Tips for Mastering Top-K Pattern**
1. **Understand Heaps:** Master min-heaps and max-heaps. Top-k problems often involve extracting the kth largest or smallest element from an unsorted array or stream, and heaps provide an efficient way to do this.
   
2. **Use Quickselect:** The Quickselect algorithm is a great tool for solving problems that require finding the kth smallest/largest element without fully sorting the array.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:** Practice problems where you need to find the top-k elements within a sliding window (e.g., the max or min in every window).

4. **Master Hashmaps and Frequency Counting:** Many top-k problems involve counting occurrences (e.g., finding the k most frequent elements).

5. **Review Sorting and Searching:** Top-K problems often leverage efficient sorting or searching methods to reduce time complexity.

By practicing these problems and mastering the underlying techniques, you'll be well-prepared for top-k pattern questions in coding interviews at top companies!
