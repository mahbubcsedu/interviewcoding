The **Sliding Window pattern** is a commonly used approach for solving array and string problems that require finding a subarray or substring that satisfies certain constraints (e.g., sum, length, or character count) within a window that slides over the array or string. It's particularly useful for problems involving **subarrays** or **substrings** where the size of the window is fixed or dynamic.

Here’s a comprehensive list of problems categorized by difficulty and concept that you can practice to prepare for sliding window problems in coding interviews:

---
