The **Two-Pointer pattern** is a powerful technique that is widely used in solving array and string problems. It involves using two pointers to iterate over the input, often starting from opposite ends of the array or moving together from one end while adjusting their positions based on certain conditions. It is particularly useful for problems related to arrays, linked lists, and strings, where you need to find pairs or subarrays that satisfy specific criteria.

Below is a comprehensive list of problems categorized by difficulty and concept that you can practice to prepare for **Two-Pointer** problems in coding interviews:
