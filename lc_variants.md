## Neeted list weight sum 339

To modify the solution to multiply each integer by its reverse depth (i.e., depth from bottom up), we need to first calculate the maximum depth of the nested list. Once we have this information, we can use a similar depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the weighted sum based on the reverse depth.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

1. **Calculate the Maximum Depth**: Use a DFS to find the maximum depth of the nested list.
2. **Calculate the Weighted Sum**: Use another DFS to calculate the sum, multiplying each integer by its reverse depth.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def depthSumInverse(nestedList):
    def get_max_depth(nested_list, depth):
        max_depth = depth
        for element in nested_list:
            if isinstance(element, list):
                max_depth = max(max_depth, get_max_depth(element, depth + 1))
        return max_depth

    def dfs(nested_list, depth, max_depth):
        total = 0
        for element in nested_list:
            if isinstance(element, int):
                total += element * (max_depth - depth + 1)
            else:
                total += dfs(element, depth + 1, max_depth)
        return total

    max_depth = get_max_depth(nestedList, 1)
    return dfs(nestedList, 1, max_depth)

# Example usage:
nestedList = [1, [2, 2], [[3], 2], 1]
print(depthSumInverse(nestedList))  # Output: 20
```

### Explanation:

1. **Get Maximum Depth**:
   - The `get_max_depth` function traverses the nested list and returns the maximum depth of the list.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function calculates the weighted sum based on the reverse depth. The reverse depth is calculated as `(max_depth - depth + 1)`.
   - For each element, if it is an integer, it multiplies the integer by its reverse depth and adds it to the total sum.
   - If the element is a list, it recursively processes the list with an increased depth.

### Example:
For the nested list `[1, [2, 2], [[3], 2], 1]`:
- Maximum depth is 3.
- Reverse depths:
  - `1` at depth 1 -> reverse depth 3
  - `2` at depth 2 -> reverse depth 2
  - `3` at depth 3 -> reverse depth 1
- The total sum is calculated as: `1*3 + 2*2 + 2*2 + 3*1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 21`.
