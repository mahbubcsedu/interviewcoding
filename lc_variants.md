## LCA for n-array tree
To handle edge cases where one or both of the nodes are not present in the n-ary tree while finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), we need to ensure that we verify the presence of both nodes before determining the LCA. If one or both nodes are not present, we should return a specific indication that the LCA does not exist.

Here's an updated implementation that handles these edge cases:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.children = []

def find_LCA(root, p, q):
    # Helper function to check if a node exists in the tree
    def node_exists(root, target):
        if root is None:
            return False
        if root == target:
            return True
        return any(node_exists(child, target) for child in root.children)

    # Check if both nodes are present in the tree
    if not node_exists(root, p) or not node_exists(root, q):
        return None
    
    def helper(root, p, q):
        if root is None:
            return None
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        found_nodes = []
        
        for child in root.children:
            node = helper(child, p, q)
            if node:
                found_nodes.append(node)
        
        if len(found_nodes) == 2:
            return root
        
        return found_nodes[0] if found_nodes else None

    return helper(root, p, q)

# Example usage:
# Constructing the n-ary tree
#         1
#       / | \
#      2  3  4
#     /|   \
#    5 6    7

root = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)
node5 = Node(5)
node6 = Node(6)
node7 = Node(7)

root.children = [node2, node3, node4]
node2.children = [node5, node6]
node3.children = [node7]

p = node5
q = node6

lca = find_LCA(root, p, q)
if lca:
    print(f"LCA of {p.value} and {q.value} is {lca.value}")  # Output: LCA of 5 and 6 is 2
else:
    print("One or both nodes are not present in the tree")
```

In this updated implementation:
- A helper function `node_exists` is added to check if a given node exists in the tree.
- Before calling the main `helper` function to find the LCA, the existence of both nodes is verified.
- If either node does not exist, the function returns `None`, indicating that the LCA does not exist.
- The rest of the `helper` function remains the same, performing the LCA search.

## Largest concatenate array (not lc)
To solve this problem, we need to arrange the numbers to form the largest possible concatenated number and then find the second highest value in that arrangement.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Convert each integer to a string to facilitate comparison.
2. Sort the strings using a custom comparator that compares the concatenated results.
3. Retrieve the second highest value from the sorted list.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

def custom_compare(x, y):
    if x + y > y + x:
        return -1
    elif x + y < y + x:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def find_second_highest(nums):
    # Convert integers to strings
    nums_str = list(map(str, nums))
    # Sort the numbers using the custom comparator
    nums_str.sort(key=cmp_to_key(custom_compare))
    # Convert sorted strings back to integers
    nums_sorted = list(map(int, nums_str))
    # Return the second highest value
    return nums_sorted[1]

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = find_second_highest(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 4
```

In this implementation:
- The `custom_compare` function compares two strings by concatenating them in different orders and checking which order results in a larger value.
- The `find_second_highest` function converts the integers to strings, sorts them using the custom comparator, and converts them back to integers.
- Finally, it retrieves and returns the second highest value from the sorted list.


## Evaluate postfix
To evaluate an expression like `( + 3 2 ( * 4 6 ) )`, which is in prefix notation (also known as Polish notation), you can use a stack-based approach. Here's how you can do it:

1. Split the input expression into tokens.
2. Process the tokens from right to left, using a stack to evaluate the expression.
3. If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
4. If the token is an operator, pop the necessary operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
5. The final result will be the last remaining value in the stack.

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def evaluate_expression(expression):
    def helper(tokens):
        token = tokens.pop()
        if token == '+':
            return helper(tokens) + helper(tokens)
        elif token == '-':
            return helper(tokens) - helper(tokens)
        elif token == '*':
            return helper(tokens) * helper(tokens)
        elif token == '/':
            return helper(tokens) // helper(tokens)
        else:
            return int(token)

    tokens = expression.split()[::-1]
    return helper(tokens)

# Example usage:
expression = "( + 3 2 ( * 4 6 ) )"
# Remove the parentheses for simplicity
expression = expression.replace('(', '').replace(')', '')
result = evaluate_expression(expression)
print(result)  # Output: 27
```

In this implementation:
- The `helper` function is a recursive function that processes the tokens in the stack.
- The `tokens` list is created by splitting the input expression and reversing the order of the tokens.
- The `helper` function evaluates the expression by recursively processing the tokens.

The example provided `( + 3 2 ( * 4 6 ) )` evaluates to `3 + 2 + (4 * 6) = 5 + 24 = 29`.



## Neeted list weight sum 339

To modify the solution to multiply each integer by its reverse depth (i.e., depth from bottom up), we need to first calculate the maximum depth of the nested list. Once we have this information, we can use a similar depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the weighted sum based on the reverse depth.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

1. **Calculate the Maximum Depth**: Use a DFS to find the maximum depth of the nested list.
2. **Calculate the Weighted Sum**: Use another DFS to calculate the sum, multiplying each integer by its reverse depth.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def depthSumInverse(nestedList):
    def get_max_depth(nested_list, depth):
        max_depth = depth
        for element in nested_list:
            if isinstance(element, list):
                max_depth = max(max_depth, get_max_depth(element, depth + 1))
        return max_depth

    def dfs(nested_list, depth, max_depth):
        total = 0
        for element in nested_list:
            if isinstance(element, int):
                total += element * (max_depth - depth + 1)
            else:
                total += dfs(element, depth + 1, max_depth)
        return total

    max_depth = get_max_depth(nestedList, 1)
    return dfs(nestedList, 1, max_depth)

# Example usage:
nestedList = [1, [2, 2], [[3], 2], 1]
print(depthSumInverse(nestedList))  # Output: 20
```

### Explanation:

1. **Get Maximum Depth**:
   - The `get_max_depth` function traverses the nested list and returns the maximum depth of the list.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function calculates the weighted sum based on the reverse depth. The reverse depth is calculated as `(max_depth - depth + 1)`.
   - For each element, if it is an integer, it multiplies the integer by its reverse depth and adds it to the total sum.
   - If the element is a list, it recursively processes the list with an increased depth.

### Example:
For the nested list `[1, [2, 2], [[3], 2], 1]`:
- Maximum depth is 3.
- Reverse depths:
  - `1` at depth 1 -> reverse depth 3
  - `2` at depth 2 -> reverse depth 2
  - `3` at depth 3 -> reverse depth 1
- The total sum is calculated as: `1*3 + 2*2 + 2*2 + 3*1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 21`.

## First and last position in an array - variant
You can efficiently find the number of elements within an inclusive range in a sorted list using binary search. The idea is to use binary search to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the lower bound of the range, and the index of the first element that is greater than the upper bound of the range. The difference between these indices will give the number of elements in the range. Here's a Python function to do this:

```python
import bisect

def count_elements_in_range(sorted_list, lower_bound, upper_bound):
    # Find the index of the first element greater than or equal to lower_bound
    left_index = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_list, lower_bound)
    
    # Find the index of the first element greater than upper_bound
    right_index = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, upper_bound)
    
    # The number of elements in the range is the difference between right_index and left_index
    count = right_index - left_index
    
    return count

# Example usage:
sorted_list = [1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
lower_bound = 3
upper_bound = 8
print(count_elements_in_range(sorted_list, lower_bound, upper_bound))  # Output: 5
```

## Stock buy and sale variant
- Given two arrays of departure prices and return prices find the minimum total cost of a trip (return has to be on the same day or after departure). Eg: D = [10, 7, 8 , 8, 9] and R = [8, 10, 7, 8, 9] -> 14 (depart on day 2 and return on day 3).

You can solve this problem by iterating through both the departure and return arrays, and finding the minimum total cost of a trip where the return happens on the same day or after the departure. Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def min_total_cost(departure_prices, return_prices):
    n = len(departure_prices)
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            total_cost = departure_prices[i] + return_prices[j]
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    
    return min_cost

# Example usage:
D = [10, 7, 8, 8, 9]
R = [8, 10, 7, 8, 9]
print(min_total_cost(D, R))  # Output: 14
```

In this function, we iterate through each departure day `i` and for each `i`, we iterate through each return day `j` starting from `i`. We calculate the total cost for each combination and keep track of the minimum total cost found.
## Find kth largest elements when k is 1-based
```python
import random
class Solution:
    

    def partition(self, nums, left, right):
        pivot_index = random.randint(left, right)
        pivot_value = nums[pivot_index]
        nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]
        store_index = left
        
        for i in range(left, right):
            if nums[i] > pivot_value:
                nums[store_index], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[store_index]
                store_index += 1
        
        nums[right], nums[store_index] = nums[store_index], nums[right]
        return store_index

    def quickselect(self, nums, left, right, k):
        if left == right:
            return nums[left]
        
        pivot_index = self.partition(nums, left, right)
        
        if k == pivot_index:
            return nums[k]
        elif k < pivot_index:
            return self.quickselect(nums, left, pivot_index - 1, k)
        else:
            return self.quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, right, k)

    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        return self.quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, k-1)

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
k = 2  # Find the 3rd largest element (zero-based index)
print(Solution().findKthLargest(nums, k))  # Output: 4
```

## Find kth largest elements when k is zero based
Sure! The Quickselect algorithm is an efficient way to find the k-th largest element in an unsorted array. Quickselect works similarly to Quicksort, but it only partially sorts the array to find the desired element.

Here's the Python implementation to find the k-th largest element using Quickselect, where k is zero-based (i.e., k=0 finds the largest element, k=1 finds the second largest element, and so on):

```python
import random

def partition(nums, left, right):
    pivot_index = random.randint(left, right)
    pivot_value = nums[pivot_index]
    nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]
    store_index = left
    
    for i in range(left, right):
        if nums[i] > pivot_value:
            nums[store_index], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[store_index]
            store_index += 1
    
    nums[right], nums[store_index] = nums[store_index], nums[right]
    return store_index

def quickselect(nums, left, right, k):
    if left == right:
        return nums[left]
    
    pivot_index = partition(nums, left, right)
    
    if k == pivot_index:
        return nums[k]
    elif k < pivot_index:
        return quickselect(nums, left, pivot_index - 1, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, right, k)

def findKthLargest(nums, k):
    return quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, k)

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
k = 2  # Find the 3rd largest element (zero-based index)
print(findKthLargest(nums, k))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **Partition Function**: The `partition` function selects a random pivot element and partitions the array such that all elements greater than the pivot are on the left, and all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the right.
2. **Quickselect Function**: The `quickselect` function uses the `partition` function to recursively narrow down the search space to find the k-th largest element.
   - If the pivot index is equal to k, we have found the k-th largest element.
   - If k is less than the pivot index, we continue the search in the left subarray.
   - If k is greater than the pivot index, we continue the search in the right subarray.
3. **Find K-th Largest Function**: The `findKthLargest` function initializes the `quickselect` function with the entire array.

This implementation ensures an efficient way to find the k-th largest element with an average time complexity of \(O(n)\).

## 560 subarray sum equal k
-When dealing with the problem of finding the number of subarrays that sum to a given value \(k\), if the numbers provided are positive only, we can make significant improvements to the algorithm. Specifically, we can use a sliding window technique to achieve a more efficient solution.

### Sliding Window Approach

In this case, since all numbers are positive, the sum of the subarray will only increase as we add more elements to it. This allows us to use a sliding window approach to maintain a valid subarray whose sum is equal to \(k\).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

```python
def subarraySum(nums, k):
    start, end = 0, 0
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0

    while end < len(nums):
        # Add the current element to the current_sum
        current_sum += nums[end]

        # Move the start pointer to the right while the current_sum is greater than k
        while current_sum > k and start <= end:
            current_sum -= nums[start]
            start += 1

        # If current_sum equals k, increment the count
        if current_sum == k:
            count += 1

        # Move the end pointer to the right
        end += 1

    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 5
print(subarraySum(nums, k))  # Output: 2 (subarrays are [2, 3] and [5])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `start` and `end` pointers, `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of elements in the window, and `count` to keep track of the number of subarrays that sum to \(k\).
2. **Expanding the Window**: Incrementally add elements to `current_sum` using the `end` pointer.
3. **Shrinking the Window**: If `current_sum` exceeds \(k\), increment the `start` pointer and subtract elements from `current_sum` until `current_sum` is less than or equal to \(k\).
4. **Counting Subarrays**: If `current_sum` equals \(k\), increment the `count`.
5. **Moving the End Pointer**: Continue expanding the window by moving the `end` pointer to the right.



### Problem Statement: (variant of max consecutive ones)
Given a list of days represented as "W" (Weekdays) and "H" (Holidays) and a number `k`, representing the maximum number of weekdays you can convert to holidays, find the maximum number of consecutive holidays you can achieve.

### Solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain the sliding window.
   - Keep track of the count of weekdays that have been converted to holidays (`current_k`).

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and increment `current_k` when a weekday is encountered.
   - If `current_k` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to reduce the window size until `current_k` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Track the maximum window size.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def maxConsecutiveHolidays(days, k):
    left = 0
    current_k = 0
    max_consecutive = 0

    for right in range(len(days)):
        if days[right] == 'W':
            current_k += 1

        while current_k > k:
            if days[left] == 'W':
                current_k -= 1
            left += 1
        
        max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_consecutive

# Example usage:
days = ["W", "H", "W", "W", "H", "W", "H", "W", "H", "H", "W"]
k = 2
print(maxConsecutiveHolidays(days, k))  # Output: 7
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Counters**:
   - `left` and `right` are pointers used to maintain the window.
   - `current_k` keeps track of the number of weekdays that have been converted to holidays within the window.

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - Move the `right` pointer to expand the window.
   - Increment `current_k` whenever a weekday ('W') is encountered.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - If `current_k` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until `current_k` is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Track Maximum Window Size**:
   - Update `max_consecutive` with the maximum size of the window observed.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - For the given `days` list and `k = 2`, the output is `7`, which is the maximum number of consecutive holidays you can achieve by converting up to 2 weekdays to holidays.
  
To include PTO (Paid Time Off) days in the calculation for maximizing consecutive off days, we can modify the solution accordingly. The approach will be similar, but we'll consider PTO days as part of our sliding window logic.

### Problem Statement:
Given a list of days represented as "W" (Weekdays), "H" (Holidays), and "P" (PTO), and a number `k`, representing the maximum number of weekdays you can convert to holidays, find the maximum number of consecutive off days (including Holidays and PTO) you can achieve.

### Solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain the sliding window.
   - Keep track of the count of weekdays that have been converted to holidays (`current_k`).

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and increment `current_k` when a weekday is encountered.
   - If `current_k` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to reduce the window size until `current_k` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Track the maximum window size.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def maxConsecutiveOffDays(days, k):
    left = 0
    current_k = 0
    max_consecutive = 0

    for right in range(len(days)):
        if days[right] == 'W':
            current_k += 1

        while current_k > k:
            if days[left] == 'W':
                current_k -= 1
            left += 1

        max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_consecutive

# Example usage:
days = ["W", "H", "P", "W", "H", "W", "P", "W", "H", "H", "W"]
k = 2
print(maxConsecutiveOffDays(days, k))  # Output: 9
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Counters**:
   - `left` and `right` are pointers used to maintain the window.
   - `current_k` keeps track of the number of weekdays that have been converted to holidays within the window.

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - Move the `right` pointer to expand the window.
   - Increment `current_k` whenever a weekday ('W') is encountered.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - If `current_k` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until `current_k` is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Track Maximum Window Size**:
   - Update `max_consecutive` with the maximum size of the window observed.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - For the given `days` list and `k = 2`, the output is `9`, which is the maximum number of consecutive off days you can achieve by converting up to 2 weekdays to holidays, considering both holidays and PTO.

Merging overlap while merging two lists can be done, but separating the steps (first merging the lists, then merging overlaps) ensures better code organization, readability, and often simplifies debugging. Let's break it down.

### Separate Steps vs. Combined Steps

1. **Separate Steps**:
   - **Step 1: Merge the two sorted lists** into a single sorted list.
   - **Step 2: Merge overlapping intervals** in the combined sorted list.

   **Advantages**:
   - Easier to understand and maintain: Each step does one thing well.
   - Reduced complexity: Sorting and merging logic are kept separate.
   - Debugging becomes simpler as errors in merging can be isolated more easily.

2. **Combined Steps**:
   - **Single Step: Merge and handle overlaps simultaneously**.

   **Challenges**:
   - Increased complexity: Handling merging and overlaps in one go can make the code harder to follow.
   - Potential for errors: Integrating multiple concerns can lead to bugs if not handled meticulously.
   - Maintenance: Future updates might require altering complex, intertwined logic.

### Implementation Example: Separate Steps

#### Step 1: Merge the Sorted Lists

```python
def mergeSortedLists(sortedIntervals1, sortedIntervals2):
    # Initialize pointers
    i, j = 0, 0
    merged = []

    # Merge the two sorted lists
    while i < len(sortedIntervals1) and j < len(sortedIntervals2):
        if sortedIntervals1[i][0] < sortedIntervals2[j][0]:
            merged.append(sortedIntervals1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(sortedIntervals2[j])
            j += 1

    # Add remaining intervals
    while i < len(sortedIntervals1):
        merged.append(sortedIntervals1[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(sortedIntervals2):
        merged.append(sortedIntervals2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged
```

#### Step 2: Merge Overlapping Intervals

```python
def mergeOverlappingIntervals(merged):
    if not merged:
        return []

    merged_intervals = [merged[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(merged)):
        last_interval = merged_intervals[-1]
        current_interval = merged[i]
        if current_interval[0] <= last_interval[1]:
            merged_intervals[-1] = [last_interval[0], max(last_interval[1], current_interval[1])]
        else:
            merged_intervals.append(current_interval)

    return merged_intervals

# Example usage:
sortedIntervals1 = [[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]]
sortedIntervals2 = [[2, 4], [6, 8], [10, 11]]

# Step 1: Merge the two sorted lists
merged = mergeSortedLists(sortedIntervals1, sortedIntervals2)

# Step 2: Merge overlapping intervals
result = mergeOverlappingIntervals(merged)
print(result)  # Output: [[1, 4], [5, 8], [9, 12]]
```

### Advantages of Separate Steps:

1. **Clarity**:
   - Each function has a clear responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Modularity**:
   - Functions can be tested individually, ensuring correctness of each step independently.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Errors can be traced back to a specific step, simplifying the debugging process.

Combining both steps can be done, but it usually leads to more complex code, which can be harder to debug and maintain. By separating the concerns, you create a more modular and understandable solution.

## Add two integers
Sure! Hereâ€™s a way to add two non-negative integers represented as strings without converting them to integers directly or using any large integer libraries. Weâ€™ll simulate the addition process as you would do manually:

1. Start from the rightmost digits and add them, carrying over the excess to the next left position if the sum is greater than 9.
2. Continue this process until all digits are added.

Hereâ€™s the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def add_strings(num1, num2):
    # Ensure num1 is the longer string
    if len(num2) > len(num1):
        num1, num2 = num2, num1
    
    result = []
    carry = 0
    len1, len2 = len(num1), len(num2)
    
    # Traverse both strings from right to left
    for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
        digit1 = int(num1[-i]) if i <= len1 else 0
        digit2 = int(num2[-i]) if i <= len2 else 0
        
        # Calculate the sum and carry
        total = digit1 + digit2 + carry
        carry = total // 10
        result.append(total % 10)
    
    # If there's a remaining carry, add it to the result
    if carry:
        result.append(carry)
    
    # Reverse the result and convert to string
    result.reverse()
    return ''.join(map(str, result))

# Example usage:
num1 = "456"
num2 = "77"
print(add_strings(num1, num2))  # Output: "533"
```

In this implementation:
- We ensure `num1` is the longer string to make the traversal simpler.
- We traverse both strings from right to left, adding corresponding digits and taking care of any carry.
- The `carry` variable keeps track of any excess that needs to be added to the next digit.
- Finally, we reverse the result list and join the digits to form the final sum as a string.

Feel free to test this code with different inputs and let me know if you have any questions!

To handle signed decimal numbers, we'll need to make some adjustments to the code:

1. **Handle the sign**: Determine whether the result should be positive or negative.
2. **Handle decimal points**: Align the numbers by their decimal points during addition.

Hereâ€™s the updated implementation:

```python
def add_strings(num1, num2):
    # Determine the sign
    sign1 = -1 if num1[0] == '-' else 1
    sign2 = -1 if num2[0] == '-' else 1
    
    if num1[0] in '+-':
        num1 = num1[1:]
    if num2[0] in '+-':
        num2 = num2[1:]
    
    # Split the numbers into integer and decimal parts
    int_part1, dec_part1 = num1.split('.') if '.' in num1 else (num1, '')
    int_part2, dec_part2 = num2.split('.') if '.' in num2 else (num2, '')
    
    # Make the decimal parts the same length by padding with zeros
    max_dec_len = max(len(dec_part1), len(dec_part2))
    dec_part1 = dec_part1.ljust(max_dec_len, '0')
    dec_part2 = dec_part2.ljust(max_dec_len, '0')
    
    # Add the integer and decimal parts separately
    int_sum = add_integer_strings(int_part1, int_part2, sign1, sign2)
    dec_sum = add_integer_strings(dec_part1[::-1], dec_part2[::-1], sign1, sign2)[::-1]
    
    # Handle carry from decimal to integer part
    if len(dec_sum) > max_dec_len:
        carry = int(dec_sum[0])
        dec_sum = dec_sum[1:]
        int_sum = add_integer_strings(int_sum, str(carry), 1, 1)
    
    # Remove trailing zeros in the decimal part
    dec_sum = dec_sum.rstrip('0')
    
    result = int_sum
    if dec_sum:
        result += '.' + dec_sum
    
    return result

def add_integer_strings(num1, num2, sign1, sign2):
    # Ensure num1 is the longer string
    if len(num2) > len(num1):
        num1, num2 = num2, num1
        sign1, sign2 = sign2, sign1
    
    result = []
    carry = 0
    len1, len2 = len(num1), len(num2)
    
    # Traverse both strings from right to left
    for i in range(1, len1 + 1):
        digit1 = int(num1[-i]) if i <= len1 else 0
        digit2 = int(num2[-i]) if i <= len2 else 0
        
        # Calculate the sum and carry
        total = digit1 * sign1 + digit2 * sign2 + carry
        carry = total // 10 if total >= 0 else -(-total // 10)
        result.append(abs(total) % 10)
    
    # If there's a remaining carry, add it to the result
    if carry:
        result.append(abs(carry))
    
    # Reverse the result and convert to string
    result.reverse()
    return ''.join(map(str, result)).lstrip('0') or '0'

# Example usage:
num1 = "-123.45"
num2 = "67.89"
print(add_strings(num1, num2))  # Output: "-55.56"

num1 = "123.45"
num2 = "-67.89"
print(add_strings(num1, num2))  # Output: "55.56"
```

In this implementation:
- We first determine the sign of each number.
- We split each number into integer and decimal parts.
- We add the integer and decimal parts separately and handle any carry from the decimal part to the integer part.
- Finally, we remove any trailing zeros in the decimal part and combine the integer and decimal parts to form the final result.


## Find cheese using api
Given a mouse with 2 APIs in a maze. Design an algorithm to find a cheese in the maze using only the 2 given APIs shown below.


```
class Mouse {

	/**
	* Moves to one of the directions (left, right, up, down) and returns false if you can't move and true if you can.
	*/
	public boolean move(Direction direction);

	/**
	* Returns true if there is a cheese in the current cell.
	*/
	public boolean hasCheese();

	/**
	* Should return true and leave the mouse at that location or false if we can't find cheese and return the mouse back to where it started.
	*/
	public boolean getCheese() {
		// your code goes here
	}
}
```

You can solve this problem by implementing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This algorithm will explore the maze by moving in all four possible directions (left, right, up, down) until the mouse finds the cheese or all possibilities are exhausted. To avoid getting stuck in a loop, the mouse should mark the cells it has already visited.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
class Direction:
    LEFT = 0
    RIGHT = 1
    UP = 2
    DOWN = 3

class Mouse:
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = set()
        self.position = (0, 0)  # Starting position

    def move(self, direction):
        # Implement the actual move API here
        # Update the position based on the direction
        if direction == Direction.LEFT:
            new_position = (self.position[0], self.position[1] - 1)
        elif direction == Direction.RIGHT:
            new_position = (self.position[0], self.position[1] + 1)
        elif direction == Direction.UP:
            new_position = (self.position[0] - 1, self.position[1])
        elif direction == Direction.DOWN:
            new_position = (self.position[0] + 1, self.position[1])
        else:
            return False

        # Placeholder for actual move function that returns True or False
        can_move = True  # This should be replaced by the actual API call

        if can_move:
            self.position = new_position
        return can_move

    def hasCheese(self):
        # Implement the actual hasCheese API here
        pass

    def get_position(self):
        return self.position

    def move_back(self, direction):
        # Move back in the opposite direction
        opposite_direction = {
            Direction.LEFT: Direction.RIGHT,
            Direction.RIGHT: Direction.LEFT,
            Direction.UP: Direction.DOWN,
            Direction.DOWN: Direction.UP
        }
        return self.move(opposite_direction[direction])

    def getCheese(self):
        def dfs():
            if self.hasCheese():
                return True

            for direction in [Direction.LEFT, Direction.RIGHT, Direction.UP, Direction.DOWN]:
                if self.move(direction):
                    if (self.get_position() not in self.visited):
                        self.visited.add(self.get_position())
                        if dfs():
                            return True
                        self.move_back(direction)  # Move back if not found
            return False

        self.visited.add(self.get_position())
        return dfs()

# Example usage:
# mouse = Mouse()
# result = mouse.getCheese()
# print(result)  # Output will depend on the actual implementation of move() and hasCheese()

```

This code:
- Uses a helper function `dfs()` for the depth-first search.
- Checks if the current cell has cheese using `self.hasCheese()`.
- Tries to move in all four possible directions.
- Marks the cells it has visited to avoid revisiting.
- Uses a `move_back` method to return to the previous position if no cheese is found in a direction.

Note that you'll need to implement the `move()`, `hasCheese()`, `get_position()`, and `move_back()` methods according to the actual maze setup and movement rules.

## Another variable of consecutive 1
Certainly! This problem can be approached similarly to the "max consecutive 1s" problem. Let's assume the input is an array where `W` represents a weekday and `H` represents a holiday. We need to determine the maximum number of consecutive holidays that can be achieved by converting a given number of weekdays to holidays.

Here's a step-by-step approach in Python:

1. Use a sliding window to keep track of the current segment of the array.
2. Maintain a counter for the number of weekdays (`W`) in the current window.
3. Expand the window by moving the right pointer and check if we can convert the current window to holidays by considering the given number of holidays that can be taken.
4. If the number of weekdays in the current window exceeds the allowable number of holidays to be taken, move the left pointer to shrink the window.
5. Track the maximum length of consecutive holidays obtained.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def max_consecutive_holidays(days, k):
    max_holidays = 0
    left = 0
    w_count = 0
    
    for right in range(len(days)):
        if days[right] == 'W':
            w_count += 1
        
        # If w_count exceeds the number of holidays we can take (k), move left pointer
        while w_count > k:
            if days[left] == 'W':
                w_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        max_holidays = max(max_holidays, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_holidays

# Example usage:
days = ['W', 'H', 'W', 'W', 'H', 'W', 'H', 'H', 'W', 'W']
k = 2
print(max_consecutive_holidays(days, k))  # Output: 6
```

In this implementation:
- `days` is the input array where `'W'` represents weekdays and `'H'` represents holidays.
- `k` is the number of holidays that can be taken (i.e., the number of weekdays that can be converted to holidays).
- The function `max_consecutive_holidays` uses a sliding window technique to find the maximum number of consecutive holidays that can be achieved.


## Range sum BST variant
Absolutely! By leveraging the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST), you can optimize the in-order traversal to stop early if a node's value is outside the specified range. Specifically, you can avoid traversing the left subtree if the current node's value is less than the lower boundary (`low`), and you can avoid traversing the right subtree if the current node's value is greater than the upper boundary (`high`).

Hereâ€™s an updated implementation that includes these optimizations:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def average_in_range(root, low, high):
    def in_order_traversal(node):
        nonlocal total_sum, count
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Only traverse the left subtree if the current node's value is greater than the lower boundary
        if node.value > low:
            in_order_traversal(node.left)
        
        # Process the current node
        if low <= node.value <= high:
            total_sum += node.value
            count += 1
        
        # Only traverse the right subtree if the current node's value is less than the upper boundary
        if node.value < high:
            in_order_traversal(node.right)
    
    total_sum = 0
    count = 0
    in_order_traversal(root)
    
    if count == 0:
        return 0  # To avoid division by zero
    
    return total_sum / count

# Example usage:
# Constructing the BST
#        5
#       / \
#      3   8
#     / \   \
#    2   4   10

root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(8)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.right = TreeNode(10)

low = 3
high = 8
print(average_in_range(root, low, high))  # Output: 5.0
```

In this implementation:
- The `in_order_traversal` function is optimized to avoid unnecessary traversals.
- The left subtree is only traversed if the current node's value is greater than `low`.
- The right subtree is only traversed if the current node's value is less than `high`.


### Island variation (min flips to connect all islands) [Very hard]
To determine the minimum number of cells you need to flip to connect all islands in a grid, you can represent the problem as a graph problem. Here's a high-level approach using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) concepts:

1. **Identify Islands**: Use BFS or Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify and label all the separate islands in the grid.
2. **Calculate Distance**: For each pair of islands, calculate the minimum number of flips required to connect them.
3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Use an MST algorithm (like Kruskal's or Prim's) to connect all islands with the minimum total number of flips.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation to illustrate the approach:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(grid, start, visited, island_id):
    q = deque([start])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = island_id
    island = []

    while q:
        x, y = q.popleft()
        island.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                visited[nx][ny] = island_id
                q.append((nx, ny))

    return island

def calculate_distance(grid, island1, island2):
    min_distance = float('inf')
    for x1, y1 in island1:
        for x2, y2 in island2:
            distance = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1
            min_distance = min(min_distance, distance)
    return min_distance

def find_min_flips(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0

    visited = [[0] * len(grid[0]) for _ in range(len(grid))]
    islands = []
    island_id = 1

    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                island = bfs(grid, (i, j), visited, island_id)
                islands.append(island)
                island_id += 1

    distances = []
    for i in range(len(islands)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(islands)):
            distance = calculate_distance(grid, islands[i], islands[j])
            distances.append((distance, i, j))

    distances.sort()
    parent = list(range(len(islands)))

    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]

    total_flips = 0
    for distance, i, j in distances:
        root_i = find(i)
        root_j = find(j)
        if root_i != root_j:
            total_flips += distance
            parent[root_i] = root_j

    return total_flips

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1]
]

print(find_min_flips(grid))  # Output depends on the grid structure
```

In this implementation:
- The `bfs` function identifies and labels each island.
- The `calculate_distance` function calculates the minimum number of flips needed to connect two islands.
- The `find_min_flips` function uses the MST concept to determine the minimum number of flips required to connect all islands.	

The time complexity of the provided solution can be analyzed based on the three main parts: identifying the islands, calculating the distances between the islands, and finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

1. **Identifying Islands (BFS/DFS)**:
   - For each cell in the grid, if it is part of an unvisited island, we perform a BFS/DFS to mark all the cells of that island.
   - This step processes each cell exactly once.
   - Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

2. **Calculating Distances between Islands**:
   - For each pair of islands, calculate the minimum distance between any two cells (one from each island).
   - If there are k islands, there are k choose 2 = O(k^2) pairs of islands.
   - For each pair, we compare all pairs of cells, leading to O(s1 * s2) comparisons, where s1 and s2 are the sizes of the two islands.
   - In the worst case, this can be O((m * n)^2) comparisons.
   - However, typically the number of islands is small compared to the number of cells, so we simplify to O(k^2 * s^2), where s is the average size of an island.

3. **Finding the MST (Kruskal's or Prim's)**:
   - The number of edges in the graph of islands is O(k^2).
   - Kruskal's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log E), where E is the number of edges.
   - Time complexity for MST: O(k^2 log k^2) = O(k^2 log k).

Combining these steps:
- Identifying Islands: O(m * n)
- Calculating Distances: O(k^2 * s^2) (typically much smaller than (m * n)^2)
- Finding MST: O(k^2 log k)

Overall, the dominant factor depends on the number of islands and their sizes. In the worst case scenario with large grids and many islands, the complexity can approach O((m * n)^2) for distance calculations. However, in practical scenarios with fewer islands, the complexity is often dominated by the grid traversal and MST calculations.

Thus, the overall time complexity can be summarized as approximately O(m * n + k^2 * s^2 + k^2 log k), which in practical cases simplifies to O(m * n).

## Draw circle given a radias
Certainly! Drawing a circle involves calculating the coordinates of points that lie on the circumference of the circle. Given a radius, we can generate these points using parametric equations of a circle.

The parametric equations for a circle with center `(h, k)` and radius `r` are:
- \( x = h + r \cos(\theta) \)
- \( y = k + r \sin(\theta) \)

where \(\theta\) ranges from 0 to \(2\pi\) (or 0 to 360 degrees).

Here's a Python function to generate the coordinates of points that form the circle:

```python
import math

def draw_circle(radius, center_x=0, center_y=0, num_points=100):
    points = []
    for i in range(num_points):
        theta = 2 * math.pi * i / num_points
        x = center_x + radius * math.cos(theta)
        y = center_y + radius * math.sin(theta)
        points.append((x, y))
    return points

# Example usage:
radius = 5
points = draw_circle(radius)
for point in points:
    print(point)
```

In this implementation:
- `radius` is the given radius of the circle.
- `center_x` and `center_y` are the coordinates of the center of the circle (default is the origin `(0, 0)`).
- `num_points` is the number of points to generate on the circumference (default is 100 for a smooth circle).

The function `draw_circle` calculates the coordinates of `num_points` evenly spaced points on the circumference of the circle and returns them as a list of tuples.


### Magic hashmap like LRU cache may be
Sure! Let's implement the `MagicMap` class with the required methods: `get(k)`, `put(k, v)`, and `putall(v)`.

The `putall(v)` method will change all the values in the dictionary to `v`. Unlike an LRU cache, which has specific functionality related to cache eviction policies, this `MagicMap` will primarily focus on managing its key-value pairs and applying batch updates to all values.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class MagicMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.map = {}
        self.default_value = None  # Store the value set by putall

    def get(self, k):
        if k in self.map:
            return self.map[k]
        if self.default_value is not None:
            return self.default_value
        return None  # Or some other default behavior if the key is not found

    def put(self, k, v):
        self.map[k] = v

    def putall(self, v):
        self.default_value = v
        self.map = {k: v for k in self.map}

# Example usage:
magic_map = MagicMap()

# Put values into the MagicMap
magic_map.put('a', 1)
magic_map.put('b', 2)

# Get values from the MagicMap
print(magic_map.get('a'))  # Output: 1
print(magic_map.get('b'))  # Output: 2
print(magic_map.get('c'))  # Output: None (key not found)

# Use putall to change all values
magic_map.putall(10)

# Get values after putall
print(magic_map.get('a'))  # Output: 10
print(magic_map.get('b'))  # Output: 10
print(magic_map.get('c'))  # Output: 10 (default value after putall)
```

In this implementation:
- The `get(k)` method returns the value associated with key `k` or the default value set by `putall`.
- The `put(k, v)` method inserts or updates the value associated with key `k`.
- The `putall(v)` method changes all existing values to `v` and sets a default value for any new keys.

This `MagicMap` class is not similar to an LRU cache, as it does not implement any caching or eviction policies. An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache typically has methods for getting and putting items, with an additional mechanism to evict the least recently used items when the cache reaches its capacity.

### count monotonic subarray
To count the number of monotonic subarrays (both increasing and decreasing) in a given array, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a Python function to accomplish this:

```python
def count_monotonic_subarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    
    # Function to count monotonic subarrays in a given direction
    def count_direction(nums, increasing=True):
        i = 0
        count = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and ((increasing and nums[j] >= nums[j - 1]) or (not increasing and nums[j] <= nums[j - 1])):
                j += 1
            count += (j - i) * (j - i - 1) // 2  # number of subarrays in current segment
            i = j
        return count
    
    # Count increasing subarrays
    count += count_direction(nums, increasing=True)
    
    # Count decreasing subarrays
    count += count_direction(nums, increasing=False)
    
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4]
print(count_monotonic_subarrays(nums))  # Output will depend on the array structure
```

In this implementation:
- The `count_direction` function counts the number of monotonic subarrays in a specified direction (`increasing` or `decreasing`).
- The function iterates through the array using two pointers to identify segments of monotonic subarrays.
- For each segment, it calculates the number of subarrays using the formula \(\frac{(j - i) \cdot (j - i - 1)}{2}\), which represents the number of subarrays in the current segment.
- The main function `count_monotonic_subarrays` calls `count_direction` twice, once for increasing and once for decreasing subarrays, and returns the total count.


## Find valley or plain
To find a "valley" or a "plain" in an array (where a valley is defined as three consecutive integers where the middle integer is less than its neighbors, and a plain is defined as three consecutive integers that are all the same value), you can iterate through the array and check each triplet of consecutive elements.

Hereâ€™s a Python function to accomplish this:

```python
def find_valley_or_plain(nums):
    valleys_and_plains = []
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:
            valleys_and_plains.append((nums[i - 1], nums[i], nums[i + 1]))
        elif nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
            valleys_and_plains.append((nums[i - 1], nums[i], nums[i + 1]))

    return valleys_and_plains

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]
result = find_valley_or_plain(nums)
print(result)  # Output: [(3, 1, 2), (4, 4, 4)]
```

In this implementation:
- The function `find_valley_or_plain` iterates through the array starting from the second element and ending at the second-to-last element.
- It checks if the current element forms a valley or a plain with its neighbors and appends the triplet to the result list if it does.
- The function returns a list of all valleys and plains found in the array.

## randomly output index of maximum value
To randomly output the index of the maximum value in an array, we can first identify all the indices of the maximum value. Then, we can randomly select one of these indices. 

Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
import random

def random_max_index(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    
    max_value = max(nums)
    max_indices = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == max_value]
    
    return random.choice(max_indices)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3]
print(random_max_index(nums))  # Output will be randomly one of the indices of 3, which can be 1, 3, or 5
```

In this implementation:
- We first check if the array is empty and return `None` if it is.
- We find the maximum value in the array using the `max` function.
- We identify all the indices where the maximum value is located using a list comprehension.
- We randomly select one of these indices using `random.choice`.
